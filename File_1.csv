0,I guess he sees politics as an opportunity to be more corrupt – Bridget Otoo on Duffour Jnr’s ambition,"Broadcaster, Bridget Otoo is puzzled over Kwabena Duffour Jnr’s decision to contest in the National Democratic Congress (NDC) parliamentary primaries despite his unimpressive performance as a leader when he served in different capacities. Duffour Jnr is eyeing the Sekyere Afram Plains seat which is being occupied by NDC’s Alex Adomako Mensah. Dr. Kwabena Duffour Jnr holds a Ph.D. and M.Sc. in Banking and International Finance from Cass Business School, United Kingdom respectively. He has also worked with the Ghana International Bank Plc London - Treasury Department and with Star Assurance Company Limited as an underwriter trainee and now wants to become a politician. Commenting on the development, Bridget Otoo in a tweet, Friday, could not fathom why Duffour Jnr would want to become a parliamentarian when he has on some occasions failed to function as a leader. ""I heard Kwabena Duffour Jnr also wants to go to Parliament? Wow. The guy who held a party the day EIB staff were on strike over unpaid salaries? Such an insensitive person wants to go to parliament. We need better people in politics, not out of touch self-centered people,"" her tweet sighted by GhanaWeb read.“For a moment think about why Kwabena Duffour Jnr wants to go to parliament. He couldn’t manage a bank, can’t pay his staff over mismanagement, holds a party the day his staff are on strike to show them he really doesn’t care. I guess he sees politics as an Opp [opportunity] to be more corrupt,” she stated in another tweet. "
1,What Ghana’s Jean Mensa said about Nigeria’s elections,"Nigerians have gone to the polls today to cast their vote for a president who will replace President Muhammadu Buhari.Three candidates have been tipped as the keen contestants in the race – Peter Obi of the Labour Party (LP), Bola Ahmed Tinubu of the All Progressives Congress (APC), and Atiku Abubakar of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP).Ahead of this, Ghana’s Chair of the Electoral Commission, Jean Mensa spoke to the Ghana Broadcasting Corporation (GBC).According to her, there are similarities between the electoral processes of both countries; Ghana and Nigeria.“There’s a level of similarity with the Ghanaian elections and these processes and systems are geared towards ensuring that the elections are transparent and open and accessible to the stakeholders.“If you look at the biometric verification devices which they call the biometric verification devices which they call the Bimodal Voter Accreditation System (BVAS) where every voter comes in, you will be verified and allowed to wait and in addition to that, they are adopting the open spaces for elections so no longer will elections be held in closed spaces, rooms, classrooms and this is something government has adopted since 1992.“Additionally, they have also adopted the posting of the pink sheet at the various centers. As we know, this was one of the recommendations that came out of the 2012 petition and so now in Ghana we have the pink sheets posted at the various polling stations. So long as your name is on the register and your biometric details are captured on the BVD, you will be allowed to vote in Ghana. Here in Nigeria, if you do not have your PVC card, you will not be allowed to vote,” Jean Mensa said."

He said the people of Navrongo only need respect and someone who is down to earth and not someone who will lord his position on them. “This is the second time I’m contesting, and I know the delegates will give me their blessings during the primary to represent them since the current MP has lost touch with the constituents and his re-election spells doom for the party in 2024”, he said."
3,Opoku-Agyemang deserves to be retained as running mate for Mahama – Kwesi Ahwoi,"A few days after the nomination form was picked for former President John Mahama to lead the largest opposition party, the National Democratic Congress (NDC), into the 2024 presidential election, a staunch member of the party, Ambassador Kwesi Ahwoi has suggested that Prof. Jane Naana Opoku-Agyemang deserves to be retained as running mate.In an exclusive interview with Starr News Eastern Regional Correspondent, Kojo Ansah at the sidelines of an event at Koforidua Technical University on Friday, Kwesi Ahwoi said even though former President Mahama has the prerogative right to appoint any running mate of choice, nothing stops him from re-appointing his 2020 running mate to partner him again into 2024.“I have made a lot of statements. I have made a statement that I will do everything to make sure President John Mahama comes back to be President of this country and of course, he has to decide who will be his running mate. I don’t see anything wrong at all and nothing that stops Prof. Jane Naana Opoku Agyemang from being the running mate”. Ambassador Kwesi Ahwoi stated.The former Interior Minister and current Chairman of Former Ambassadors and High Commissioners under the NDC, dismissed old-age arguments against Prof.Jaane Naana Opoku Agyemang. He said Prof.Jane Naana Opoku Agyemang, can rise to become the next President after John Mahama.“People are talking about age and all. Age is not a concern. Age is being made a concern because we have a leadership today that is making age look like we have lost track. But if I tell you my age standing here you will be amazed but I have not lost track. So Naana whether she is 78, 79, or 80 can still be President of this country when President John Mahama finishes his service, that should not be a worry at all. Senior Kwabena Duffuor is putting in his cap. Kwabena Duffuor should be getting close to 79, what does he get to do with that, he got his brains, he got everything that he can use to lead this country.so I don’t see anything wrong with that(old age), Is it because Naana is a woman?” he quizzed.Ambassador Kwesi Ahwoi said it is about time women are given opportunity to rule the country given the fact that men have been tried enough.“It is about time we put a woman in charge of this country . They have a lot to offer this country. We have tried men, we’ve seen where men have taken us. Let’s try the women”.Answering a question about whether or not Prof. Jaane Naana Opoku-Agyemang, will attract more votes for the NDC when made running mate to seal the party’s victory, Kwasi Ahwoi said Central region is an amorphous region therefore the seemingly poor performance of the party in 2020 should not be a litmus test for her re-appointment as running mate.“It is the party that brings numbers it is not really the individual….if the party is strong the candidate is only a reflection of the party. But specifically, she also has her constituency, she can pull resources, and she can pull people. Most people are not calculating things well they think we lost in the central region. We lost the presidential election in Centralia Region because people forget that the central region is an amorphous region. It is not only Fantes. Central region is a combination of Ashantes, Akyems, Denkyiras just name it so don’t look at Fante and say because Naana is a Fante he should bring Central region, no! We have to go beyond that”.Prof Jane Naana Opoku-Agyemang, an academician, the first female Vice-Chancellor of the University of Cape Coast, and a former Education Minister was the running mate for the 2020 Presidential candidate of NDC John Dramani Mahama.However, lost the election to incumbent President Nana Akufo-Addo of the ruling New Patriotic Party who polled 6,730,587 represented 51.30% as against 6,213,182 vote representing 47.36% polled by John Dramani Mahama of the NDC."
4,Whoever wants to replace Mahama must work 10 times harder – Senior Research Fellow,"Senior Research Fellow at Kumasi Technical University, Dr. Smart Sarpong, has averred that contenders of John Dramani Mahama in the National Democratic Congress (NDC) presidential race would need to put in more effort to beat him.According to him, whoever emerges as the winner would have to go the extra mile to oust the governing New Patriotic Party (NPP) from office in the 2024 general elections.Speaking on Oyerepa FM on February 23, 2023, he said, ""If you are going for a battle and you don’t note the quantum of work you have to do, you start from the failing point. If we want to put President Mahama aside, the work we will have to put into it is 10 times more than he would have done before we can unseat the NPP.""""If someone wants to be the flagbearer, what Mahama would have done using 3 or 5 tactics, the rest of them, Kojo Bonsu, Ernest and Duffour, they have to accept that they have to work 10 times harder than John Mahama would have in order to take the flagbearership,"" he added.The National Democratic Congress (NDC) officially closed nominations for the flagbearer position on Friday, February 24, 2023.At the close of nominations, four aspirants which include former President John Dramani Mahama, picked forms to contest in the race.The other three contestants were Dr. Kwabena Duffour, Kojo Bonsu, and Ernest Kwaku Kobeah.Meanwhile, the presidential and parliamentary primaries have been slated for Saturday, May 13, 2023.ESA/WA"

6,NDC needs Mahama more than he needs the party – Former Obuasi MCE,"A member of the National Democratic Congress (NDC), Kwasi Ofori Agyemang also known as Zuba has stated that John Dramani Mahama loses nothing if he is not given the opportunity to lead the NDC in the election 2024.He believes John Dramani Mahama has accomplished a lot in his career and the NDC will suffer greatly if the party does not win the next general elections on the wings of the former president’s popularity and credentials.Speaking on EIB Networks English platform in Kumasi monitored by MyNewsGh.com, Zuba noted the establishment within the party will make everything possible to get Mahama elected in its upcoming presidential primaries.“Within the Ghanaian society when the establishment wants to go left, and you decide to go right you might not see yourself well. The (NDC) establishment is for Mahama,” Zuba said.“The people who call the shots in NDC are all on Mahama’s side. NDC needs John Mahama more than he needs us, the NDC needs John Mahama more than he needs the party. If John Mahama is not on the ticket, he loses nothing, all the treatment that will be given to a president and I mean any president that comes same conditions of services goes to him”, he revealedHe is therefore urging the NDC not to make a mistake by not giving Mahama the opportunity to lead the party.“We should not make a mistake by allowing just anybody to lead this great party to victory in 2024. It is Mahama or no other person,” he warned."
7,"NDC, NPP can't solve Ghana's probems, give CPP a chance – Chairperson","The chairperson of the Convention Peoples Party (CPP) Nana Akosua Frimpomaa Sarpong Kumankumah, has called on Ghanaians to consider CPP in the upcoming 2024 general elections. She said that the party is better positioned to address Ghana's issues utilizing Dr Osagyefo Kwame Nkrumah's 1960 seven-year development strategy, which she believes is still relevant today. Speaking at the news conference held in Accra, on Friday 24, 2023 to commemorate the 57th anniversary of the overthrow of Dr Kwame Nkrumah and the CPP government, she argued that neither the governing New Patriotic Party (NPP) nor the National Democratic Congress (NDC) has anything to offer Ghanaians and for that matter, they need to be voted out in the upcoming elections.“The duopoly cannot solve the problems. It is no magic, it is a formula, and as I said, success is duplicable. It is cut and paste. Once it’s working, cut and paste it…political independence without economic independence is meaningless, and that is what we are experiencing today,” she said. Nana Akosua Kumankumah added that the NPP and opposition NDC had shown over the years that, they did not have what was needed to deliver the development Ghanaians desired. “The leadership is not supposed to be blamed. It is we, the Ghanaians, that need to be blamed because if they would have done it, they would have done it by now,” the chairperson added.Watch the latest edition of BizTech and Biz Headlines below:Watch the latest edition of Business Moments below:AM/SARA"
8,I have what it takes to break the 8 with NPP - Alan Kyerematen,"Alan Kyerematen, New Patriotic Party (NPP) flagbearer hopeful, has indicated that he stands a better chance of breaking the eight-year mantra for his party.  According to Alan Kyerematen, with the current economic challenges in the country, what the NPP needed was a candidate who is appealing to the masses to enable the party to break the 8-year power chain. “I think the most difficult challenge that confronts us as a party going into the general election is finding a leader who goes beyond the NPP in terms of his or her own record. We need a candidate whom you can market to the people of Ghana but not just the NPP,” he said. The flag bearer hopeful said this during a visit to the Upper East Region when he met with party executives, the clergy, traders, drivers, and supporters of the NPP.  Alan Kyerematen stated that winning an election in Ghana goes beyond political party and added that the individual leading the party must be appealing to the masses, “I think I fit the bill not just because I have been in this game for some time, but my appeal cut across political parties, religion and ethnic divide.”  The former Trade and Industry Minister who also spoke on URA Radio in Bolgatanga as part of his campaign tour to the region said his vision about transforming Ghana that started about 22 years ago could have fetched the country not less than 50 billion dollars (about $150 per person in the US) every year if the vision had been continued. “So, you can imagine the transformation that would have occurred from that time up to now. As a country, it is time for you to have a new leader that understands business and understands how to move the private sector and support the productive sectors of our economy,” he added. Under his leadership as Trade and Industry Minister, Alan Kyerematen said with support from the private sector, over 296 factories were established in different districts across the country in the past three and half years of the establishment of the government’s flagship policy ‘one district, and factory’. “Two years ago, when I started talking about producing and assembling cars here in Ghana, people were not so sure. But to the glory of God, now we have all the major global auto companies assembling cars here in Ghana. Volkswagen, VW, Toyota, Nissan, Kia, Hyundai, and very soon, Isuzu, Honda. All these things could not happen by chance but the result of a big vision and that is what you need as a leader,” he stated"

And I believe all these sterling qualities will come to bear in delivering the right leadership for Ketu North,” Mr Hamenoo said.The Deputy Secretary for Pro-Forum North America said the decision to withdraw from the race and to support Dr Agumenu was to continue to support the Party in his current position for the time being.“The urge to serve my people of Ketu North is still alive. However, given my recruitment and involvement in other highly important NDC Party engagements at other levels, engagements, which will take a significant chunk of my time, I have decided not to look into two bottles with one eye at this time,” he said.The National Democratic Congress would hold its presidential and parliamentary primaries on Saturday, May 13, 2023, to elect a flagbearer and parliamentary candidates for the 2024 elections."

We want someone who will take the fight to the opponent and not the one who will rather fight the one fighting the opponent,” Kennedy Osei Nyarko wrote on his official Facebook wall.“It seems that Dr. Bawumia is a problem for his political rivals. I’ve been involved in Ghanaian politics for a very long time, and I can attest that Dr. Bawumia is one of our country’s top communicators. He is coherent, articulate, and laser-focused.”He added: “He makes economics very simple. He is able to reduce very complicated issues, so, I see why he represents a problem and a challenge for some people. I think the town hall meeting was a useful exercise.”"

17,Ghana won’t need IMF bailout if government deals with corruption - Asah Asante,"A senior lecturer at the University Ghana Political Science Department, Dr. Kwame Asah Asante has said that the country will be able to forgo the IMF bailout and its conditions if the government manages corruption well.Ghana officially contacted the International Monetary Fund to seek financial support. The external creditors provided Ghana with a certain criterion the country must meet to secure a possible $3 billion bailout.The government introduced the Domestic Debt Exchange Program (DDEP) to restructure debt as part of the steps to reach board-level approval with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) on a $3 billion facility to restore macroeconomic stability in the country.The government targeted 80% participation in the program to help restructure 137.3 billion Ghana cedis in bonds on the domestic market to bring its total debt, which stands at about 575.5 billion Ghana cedis to sustainable levels.Speaking on Morning Starr the Political Scientist said that the government’s mismanagement of corruption is the reason we need to accept all these conditionalities from IMF for a possible bailout.“We are so excited that IMF is going to give us close to 3 billion for starters and all that. But if we manage corruption very well, I’m afraid we will not need that money with its attendant problems and conditions. Let’s look at the issue of waste and a lot of information are available within the auditor general’s report year by year. How far have we come, and how far have we learned from them to continue to see these things in our books? It is unfortunate.“If you look at issue of waste, in terms of projects we pursue. Projects that have little or no benefit for society and then we are in there. We undertake projects without records of stakeholder engagement, and when people raise their voices those projects become abandoned and we adjust to devising such projects. We have seen issues of misapplication of state resources. In the sense that the constitution makes it mandatory for all government that when you inherit power, any project that is done using state money you will continue,” Dr. Asante explained.He continued; “But there are buildings today that are languishing in the bush and that we don’t seem to care about it. we forget that state money was put into such resources. Look at the way we execute contracts in this country as if there is no supervisor of contracts that the state has awarded. We do it anyhow and people benefit from that through poor supervision and poor execution of state projects. What is more, is that we see even some is that we see of these contracts ending up in judgement debt.”"

Reacting to the statement made by Hanna Bissiw after she, Gloria Huze, picked up nomination forms on behalf of one of the aspirants in the race to become the NDC’s flagbearer, Dr. Kwabena Duffuor. Huze had led some grassroot members of the NDC to pick the forms on behalf of the former Minister of Finance, but had been called out by Hanna Bissiw thereafter, stating that her action was without the support of the national government. “My attention has been drawn to a deplorable and unacceptable action by the Ashanti Regional Women's Organiser, Gloria Huze, in the upcoming flagbearer race. “She is on record to have led a delegation to pick up the nomination form for a Presidential Candidate Aspirant in the name of the Ashanti Regional Women's Wing.“I vehemently and categorically disassociate the wing from her conduct and wish to state emphatically that her conduct is not in any way a representation of any parts of the wing either in the Ashanti Region or across the other 15 regions in the country,” parts of the statement copied to GhanaWeb read.But in a response, Gloria Huze has stated that what she did do so on behalf of the women’s wing of the party.“For the avoidance of doubt and to set the record straight, I led NDC grassroots members whom I was representing, NOT the Ashanti Regional Women’s Wing NOR the Women Wing of our party as it is being alleged.“I have clarified my statement on several platforms including radio stations among others,” she said in a disclaimer. Gloria Huze further stated that while she is quite surprised at the response by Dr. Hanna Bissiw, she expected that the focus would rather be on how the NDC can rather reclaim power from the incumbent New Patriotic Party. She stated that beyond the internal differences they have, she expects that such energies would be directed at their external opponents as the goal is for the party to win power in 2024. She, therefore, apologized for any errors she may have committed, while calling for moderation in the way such matters are handled in the party, so as not to escalate tensions and tear the NDC up from within. “I wish to indicate to all party members that we have a common enemy to gather our arsenals for but not ourselves, irrespective of our preferences in our internal elections. At the end of the day, every one of us is needed at the table and on the field to push our common agenda of removing the NPP from power. This will be critical regardless of our individual preferences. “We should therefore exercise moderation and not attempt to escalate verbal slips to make a whole issue that has the tendency of creating avoidable disunity. Whilst I acknowledge my verbal slips and apologize for whatever inconvenience it might have caused, I believe my clarification should put the matter to rest,” she added. Dr. Kwabena Duffuor has picked up nomination forms to contest the position of the flagbearer of the NDC, and is expecting to face off with the former president of Ghana, John Dramani Mahama.

34,NDC presidential primaries: I'm pained Dr. Duffuor won't win - Governance lecturer,"Dr. Benjamin Otchere-Ankrah says former President John Dramani Mahama will tromp his competitors in the impending National Democratic Congress (NDC) presidential primaries.The party opened its presidential and parliamentary nomination on Wednesday, February 22, 2023 and former President John Mahama has picked his nomination forms to contest the NDC flagbearer race.Professor Joshua Alabi, a former Rector of the University of Professional Studies picked the forms on behalf of Mr. Mahama at the party’s headquarters.“Ghanaians are asking for a well-experienced leader, leadership counts. If leadership counts then experience is the key, one who has done it before and one who is very humble, one who loves the people and one who believes in people-centred policies. ""Fortunately for us in the NDC, as a country, we have somebody like that,” Prof. Alabi said while declaring the former President's readiness to lead the NDC.However, other candidates have popped up to contend for the Presidential candidate spot during the NDC primaries scheduled in May this year; names such as the former Finance Minister, Dr. Kwabena Duffour and a former Metropolitan Chief Executive of Kumasi, Kojo Bonsu have come up.To Dr. Benjamin Otchere-Ankrah, there is no shred of doubt that Mr. Mahama is the favorite of the party delegates.In his estimation, there is no hope for the other candidates so far as the NDC Presidential race is concerned.""President Mahama will not get anything less than 80 percent . . . the one whose own pains me a lot is Dr. Duffour; a fine gentleman. He qualifies and all that but unfortunately he won't win. I believe Kojo Bonsu will also pick his forms but he won't get up to 3 percent . . . The majority of the party members have made up their minds to vote for President Mahama,"" he asserted while speaking to Kwami Sefa Kayi on Peace FM's ""Kokrokoo"" morning show.TWI NEWS"
35,I am doing it for my granddaughter – Mahama unbothered about unpaid emoluments,"Former President John Dramani Mahama has resurrected the discussion on the payment of his emoluments as an ex-Ghanaian leader. According to Mr Mahama, he is entitled to some benefits according to Parliament but those entitlements have been withheld because he is politically active.“I’ve been Vice President before, I’ve been President of this country before, according to parliament, I’m supposed to receive all kinds of emoluments to pay my fuel and my electricity bill, my water bill, medical bills, air travel, vehicles, everything but I can assure you that all those emoluments have been withheld because I’m politically active,” he said.Mr Mahama reiterated this in his interaction with his former appointees in Accra on Wednesday, 22 February 2023, where he called on them to come out of retirement and join him in the fight to reclaim power in 2024.“If I was retired and not commenting on national issues, I would have all those emoluments paid but it doesn’t bother me, because of my new granddaughter and my children, I believe that the future of this country is one that we must rescue from the hands of this looting brigade and reset the Ghanaian project, bring back good governance, strengthen the fight against corruption, put in place the things that will make it impossible for another president to come and land us in the same ditch that we currently are, and so I’m the first to announce to you that even though I was retired in 2016, I’ve come out of retirement and I’m available for the task ahead.”Last year, Mr Mahama made similar comments about his emoluments.He had said in an interview with Accra-based TV3 on Monday, 12 September 2022, that: “I receive only my monthly pension, like President Kufuor or President Rawlings was receiving until he died. That is all I get.”"

37,NDC flagbearership: Step back for now - Ade Coker to Mahama’s contenders,"A former Greater Accra Chairman for the National Democratic Congress (NDC), Mr. Joseph Ade Coker, has urged flagbearer hopefuls of the NDC who have picked nomination forms to contest at the upcoming presidential primaries to step back now and support the former president, John Dramani Mahama, to win the spot.He was of the belief that the 2024 election was going to be a tough one, and therefore, the NDC needed someone who has a lot of positives to win back power from the current government.According to him, the party at this point needs a more united front, so those who step down would be rewarded by the party.Former President John Dramani Mahama officially picked up nomination forms to run in his party’s upcoming presidential primaries.Former  presidential aspirant Joshua Alabi picked presidential nomination forms on Wednesday, February 22, 2023, on behalf of former President John Mahama at the NDC headquarters in Adabraka.On the same day, another Presidential hopeful, Ernest Kwaku Kobeah, picked his nomination forms.The former Chief Executive of the Kumasi Metropolitan Assem­bly (KMA), Kojo Bonsu, was the third to pick the nomination forms to contest the upcoming presidential primaries of the NDC.Speaking on Atinka TV‘s morning show, Ghana Nie with Ama Gyenfa Ofosu Darkwa, Mr. Joseph Ade Coker said, “My advice to those who would be contesting is that, even though they have gone for forms and we have been talking to them, I believe that they should look at the larger picture of the NDC. ""We do not want a situation where, by the time we finish, we are divided; we do not want that. There is room for everybody in the party, and at the appropriate time, we can consider them.”When asked who could possibly bring division based on what he said, he replied that “as human beings, they might not come on board and definitely, even if he had five votes, those votes are very important, but they will say that because you did not vote for their favorite, they are going to sit home.” “It is our appeal to them, and it is a strong appeal, that before they file their nominations, they should come to talk with us and take a step back.”“It should be unconditional,” he continued, “but we as a party reward ourselves; we would reward those who show love to the party; we have a mechanism for showing appreciation, but it does not come with conditions; when you come with conditions, it is not good; open your heart to do something; people will appreciate you, and we would all be winners.”"

40,'Cul de sac' economic management orientation leading us nowhere - Alan Kyerematen,"Presidential hopeful of the New Patriotic Party (NPP), Alan Kyerematen, has described the economic policies pursued over the years by several governments as a 'cul de sac.'Speaking on URA Radio in Bolgatanga in the Upper East leg of his nationwide tour, Alan Kyerematen pointed out that the narrow focus of Ghana's continued reliance on cocoa, gold, and a few primary raw material exports, is a cul de sac orientation to economic management, and which has limited growth in the economy. Doing things the same way over and over returns the same results. Cocoa, for example, has brought in under $2billion per annum into the Ghanaian economy annually over the past decades. However, the President's Special Intitiatives (PSIs), initiated by Alan Kyerematen, comprising four simple local products: salt, oil palm, cassava and garments, could have unleashed a potential combined annual income stream of $60b a year. However, policy distortion and irregular political choices reduced the nations' capacity to grow and benefit from the PSI's. Currently, the ten point strategic growth pillars developed and being implemented under Hon. Kyerematen, during his tenure as Minister for Trade and Industry, has brought in 1D1F, the automotive industry, and others. Speaking to the Great Transformational Plan  (GTP), Alan inspires that the country deserves leadership with a big vision. A vision that moves us beyond the cul de sac into strategic growth areas following through on the GTP. Alan Kyerematen is also primary to the design, establishment and implementation of the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA), which brings together a market of nearly a billion and a half consumers for producers within the diversified economy necessary to expand opportunities for the youth. On the same programme, Mr Alan Kyerematen reiterated his desire to modernise the New Patriotic Party (NPP) into a formidable force to better drive public policy and thence enable better mobilisation of communities towards opportunities. Not only will he create a businesslike Party, capable of generating independent financial, technical and human resources but also a big voice into Government appointments, especially at local level. The Upper East Region is the tenth region to have been visited by the Alan Kyerematen for President Campaign after Ashanti, Bono East, Bono, Ahafo, Western North, Volta, Eastern, Oti and Northern regions."
41,You’ve made us proud – Youth group that paid for Ato Forson’s nomination forms,"A youth group in the Ajumako Enyan Essiam constituency has paid a sum of GHC 5,000 for nomination forms for the Minority Leader of Parliament, Hon. Cassiel Ato Forson.According to the group known as CAF BOARD, Ato Forson has made them and the entire Ajumako Enyan Essiam Constituency proud by being an efficient MP, hence their decision to pay for his nomination forms to enable him to contest again.The group has pledged to vigorously campaign and support Ato Forson to retain the seat in the 2024 election, as well as John Dramani Mahama to become President.The Ajumako Enyan Essiam Constituency Communication Officer, Mr. Galahad Alex Andoh, received the money and promised to work hard together with all NDC supporters for Ato Forson to record a landslide in the election."
42,Why are you running from Bawumia’s role on the Economic Management Team - NPP MP to Majority Whip,"The New Patriotic Party (NPP) Member of Parliament (MP) for Mpraeso, Davis Ansah Opoku, has confronted his Majority Chief Whip, Frank-Annoh Dompreh, over his claim that Alan Kyeramanten was the chairman of the Economic Committee of Cabinet. The Majority Chief Whip in a tweet shared on Thursday, February 23, 2023, provided ‘evidence’ to back his claim that the New Patriotic Party (NPP) presidential hopeful, Alan Kyerematen, was the head of the Economic Committee of the Cabinet of the Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo government.Frank Annoh-Dompreh, during an interview on Adom TV interview, monitored by GhanaWeb refuted suggestions by supporters of Alan that Vice President Mahamudu Bawumia will not be a good messenger for the NPP for the 2024 elections because he is responsible for the economic hardship in Ghana, as the head of the country’s Economic Management Team.Annoh-Dompreh, the Member of Parliament (MP) for Nsawam Adoagyiri said that Alan is equally responsible for Ghana’s economic meltdown because he is the head of the Economic Management Committee of the Cabinet of Ghana.The 'evidence' he provided was a portion of a purported document of the Cabinet of Ghana which showed a list of members of the Economic Committee and the Minister for Trade and Industry was the chairperson of the committee.The other members of the committee were the Minister for Finance, who was the “Alternate Chairperson” of the committee; the Minister for Food and Agriculture; Minister for Energy; Minister for Employment and Labour Relations; the Minister for Fisheries and Aquaculture Development; Minister for Public Enterprises; the Senior Presidential Advisor and the Presidential Advisor on the Economy.Reacting to this in an interview on Adom FM on Thursday, February 23, 2023, Davis Ansah Opoku said that he is surprised by the actions of the Majority Chief Whip.He said every Ghanaian knows that the Economic Management Team, which is set up by the president, is responsible for providing advice on the running of the economy.He added that the Economic Committee of Cabinet only presents programmes of the various ministry under it during Cabinet meetings. “I’m surprised, this thing is being led by Annoh Dompreh and I don’t see that need for it… cabinet has sub-committees according to the sectors of the economy. Because all the ministries cannot bring their programmes to cabinet meetings so these committees collect all the programmes of ministries under them and present them during the meetings.“But when it comes to the management of the economy, it is the Economic Management Team that has been responsible for it since and nobody should run away from it,”  he said Twi.He questioned why the chairperson of the Economic Committee does not address Ghanaians on the economy if s/he is indeed superior to the head of the Economic Management Team, who is required to do so.Watch the interview below:Meanwhile, catch the latest GhanaWeb TV Election Desk interview with Francis Addai-Nimoh, as he discusses his plans to become the NPP's flagbearer, below:You can also watch this episode of People & Places on GhanaWeb TV below:IB/OGB"
43,NPP Primaries: I pray for a Bawumia-NAPO ticket - Egyapa Mercer,"The Deputy Minister for Energy, Andrew Egyapa Mercer, has stated that Vice President Mahamudu Bawumia has his complete support for the New Patriotic Party (NPP) presidential primaries.According to him, even though he has good relations with all the people who have stated their intention of contesting in the primaries, Bawumia has proven that he is the best among them.Speaking in an Adom TV interview monitored by GhanaWeb, he added that the ideal situation would be for the NPP to have Bawumia as the presidential candidate of the party and the Minister for Energy, Dr. Matthew Opoku Prempeh (NAPO), as his running mate.“I support Bawumia 500%. This is an internal election… All the people who have expressed interest in contesting in the primaries are eminently qualified and they have all worked for the New Patriotic Party.“But when I look at the entirety of the eminent personals, I think that His Excellence the Vice President stands tall, no matter how you look at it – his competencies, his track record, his personality (how he relates with people), the digitalisation agenda that he is driving to transform the face of our economy,” he said in Twi.The Deputy Minister for Energy, who is also the Member of Parliament for Sekondi, described Dr. Matthew Opoku Prempeh, as a machine who together with Bawumia will transform Ghana.“It is my prayer that if by God’s grace, Dr Bawumia becomes our flagbearer, his running mate will be Dr Matthew Opoku Prempeh. Dr Matthew Opoku Prempeh is a machine and we need a machine to deliver,” he said.The MP also said that he is confident that the Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo government will turn things after the International Monetary Fund (IMF) bailout it is seeking is completed.The likes of the former Trade and Industry Minister Alan Kyerematen Assin, Central MP Ken Agyapong, Vice President Dr. Mahamudu Bawumia, the former Food and Agriculture Minister, Dr. Owusu Afriyie Akoto, ex-Mampong MP Francis Addai-Nimoh and Regional Cooperation Minister Dr Kofi Konadu Apreku, are expected to face off in the race for the flagbearership position of the NPP.Watch the interview below:Meanwhile, catch the latest GhanaWeb TV Election Desk interview with Francis Addai-Nimoh, as he discusses his plans to become the NPP's flagbearer, below:You can also watch this episode of People & Places on GhanaWeb TV below:IB/OGB"
44,NPP primaries: Only Bawumia has an overwhelming Ashanti MPs endorsement – Dr. Boako,"The spokesperson of Vice President Dr. Mahamudu Bawumia, Dr. Gideon Boako, has revealed that any of the candidates contesting for the New Patriotic Party’s (NPP) flagbearership who gets the support of five incumbent Members of Parliament(MP) in the Ashanti region will win the election.He was also quick to shoot down claims from pro-Alan elements that Dr. Bawumia as flagbearer will reduce the votes of the party in the Ashanti Region; arguing that the Vice President has over the years endeared to the people of the Ashanti Region even more than candidates from the region.Dr. Gideon Boako was speaking on Wontumi Radio when he made this known.“The Ashantis are not looking for people who will just say I can trace my roots there or they come from that place. They are looking for someone who will relate well with them and not have the boss, subordinate relationship.You can be from there but you are not humble enough to have time for the party members. They see Bawumia and he is like a son to the Ashantis. He endears so much to the party and they know him very well. He comes for funerals and joins most social gatherings in the region. During campaigns, he’s the one they see. You can say you are from the Ashanti Region but have the people seen you campaigning for the party in the region before?""If you want a position in the NPP and you tell the people from Ashanti Region that they have to vote for you, what the NPP members in the Ashanti Region will ask you is when was the last time you came to Bosome Freho or Ejura to campaign. They can say that Bawumia who you claim is not from Ashanti Region 2020, 2016 campaign we were with him in the Ashanti Region.The Ashanti party is closer to Bawumia than anything. This is right from the grassroots. When we come to the Ashanti Region, you’ll get lots of the chairmen, and constituency chairmen following Vice President.Out of the number of MPs in the Ashanti Region, if any candidate apart from Bawumia is able to get more than five MPs supporting them, I will say they will win the election. Bawumia will have the support. Bawumia will get not less than 80% of the Ashanti MPs supporting him. When some persons who said they are from the Ashanti Region went back home, they had only two MPs behind them. But when Bawumia is in the Ashanti Region, he has full support from the grassroots upwards. This is an indication of who the people want. Per what I’ve seen, there’s no candidate who can command even 30% of the Ashanti Region votes apart from Bawumia,” he said."
45,Duffour will not win any votes even within his constituency – Lecturer,"Senior Lecturer at the Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology, Dr. Michael Damoah has made a rather gloomy projection of the electoral odds for Dr. Kwabena Duffour ahead of the 2024 general elections.The former Bank of Ghana Governor is contesting other contenders including the 2020 Flagbearer of the National Democratic Congress (NDC), John Dramani Mahama, for the keen position of leading the party to victory in the 2024 elections.Dr. Duffour picked up his nomination forms at the party’s headquarters on Thursday, February 23, 2023.But speaking about his chances of winning against the 2-time flagbearer for the party, Dr. Damoah said the former has very little probabilities. “I don’t think even within his constituency, Dr. Duffour can win to beat John Mahama,” he said while speaking to Oyerepa FM’s Kwesi Parker Wilson. Meanwhile, scores of individuals believed to be in the camp of Dr. Duffour, earlier on Thursday, thronged the NDC headquarters, singing and cheering for him.Dressed in party colours, with various party paraphernalia and wielding placards with posters of Dr. Duffour, these enthusiasts threw their support behind Dr. Duffour, while one of the party’s theme songs played in the background.This comes after representatives of Former President, John Dramani Mahama, Former Kumasi Mayor, Kojo Bonsu and Businessman, Ernest Kwaku Korbeah all picked up their nomination forms on Wednesday, February 22, 2023.The forms pegged at 30,000 Ghana Cedis will be filled and returned to the party’s Elections Committee. Candidates will then be vetted and when approval is given, they can then begin campaign.

47,Lawyer Wahid Bampuori-Iddrisu picks form to contest Wa Central Parliamentary Primaries," Lawyer Wahid Bampuori-Iddrisu has picked parliamentary candidate nominee forms to contest the primaries on the ticket of the National Democratic Congress on May 13, 2023. The Accra-based senior party member and legal practitioner has consistently contested the seat in Wa Central. This is his third attempt he’s seeking to annex the seat from the incumbent Rashid Pelpuo. The information available to GhanaWeb indicates that Mr. Bampuori-Iddrrisu (Esq) is the preferred candidate for most party stakeholders and stalwarts in the constituency. According to a constituency executive, among other things, “Wahid’s consistency and commitment to party activities though he lost the primaries on two occasions is giving him some sympathy and sense of acceptance”. The source added that Wahid has a very good message that is being delivered on a clean and honest campaign. The 56-year-old legal luminary was also described as genuinely generous, friendly, and well-networked enough to lead the party in parliament. ""He was the first and only member of the NDC that has constructed and donated two party offices  which he built from his own resources to the constituency,"" the source added. The constituency seems to be drifting away from the 18 years of leadership of the incumbent and 12 years of neglect of the constituency by Hudu Mogtari to the generous lawyer and founding member of the party. The Wa Central seat will be keenly contested but critics observe that Lawyer Wahid’s team is too slow and seems drowned in the cross-fire between Rashid Pelpuo and Hudu Mogtari's teams. YNA/WA"
48,Your preferred candidate sponsored Ramadan to win Adenta seat from NPP - Annoh-Dompreh told,"The Deputy Spokesperson for Alan Kyerematen, Richard Nyamah, has claimed that it is because a powerful person within the New Patriotic Party (NPP) heavily invested in the campaign of the sitting Member of Parliament for Adenta, Mohammed Adamu Ramadan, that he won the seat. It is worth noting that the current MP is a member of the opposition National Democratic Congress (NDC), but is also the sister of the wife of the vice president, Samira Bawumia. According to Richard Nyamah, the only reason Yaw Buaben Asamoa, a one-time MP for the Adentan constituency was unable to retain that seat is because of the contributions of this powerful person, who he described as Annoh-Dompreh's preferred choice.  He said this while reacting to an earlier interview of the Majority Chief Whip in Parliament, Frank Annoh-Dompreh, on Adom TV, where the legislator dared Buaben Asamoa to win back the Adenta seat which has, for many years, been a New Patriotic Party (NPP) seat. “The Hon MP further went ahead to malign Hon Yaw Buaben Asamoa, former MP for Adentan and former Director of NPP Party Communications, now Spokesperson and Director of Communications for the Alan Kyerematen Campaign, by casting untrue aspersions on his person and character and then cheekily damning him to dare to win back the Adentan Parliamentary Seat, lost to the Party in the 2020 General elections. The real question is why and how the seat was lost. “If the Hon Annoh-Dompreh is not familiar with the story of how his preferred candidate for leadership of the NPP reportedly helped invest heavily in his brother-in-law to gift an NPP held seat to our main opponents, then he is indeed doing the High Office of Chief Whip an injustice. “It is the business of the Chief Whip to have his finger on the pulse of the Party but his aspersions in respect of Adentan Constituency show that either he is not on top of his game or that he has deliberately blinded himself to further the interests of his preferred candidate, even if the parliamentary preferences of his candidate have been hurtful to the fortunes of the NPP.  Now the question that begs answering is, will Annoh-Dompreh be singing praises to his preferred candidate if he was destooled by his brother-in-law from the NDC with the tacit support of the Vice President of the land?” he wrote. Richard Nyamah also refuted claims by the MP that Alan Kyerematen was in charge of an Economic Management Committee. He indicated that there is no such committee and that if there is, then Frank Annoh-Dompreh should produce its members, as well as its mandate.

53,Government is restoring pre-COVID-19 economic stability and growth – Richard Ahiagbah,"Director of Communications for the governing New Patriotic Party (NPP), Richard Ahiagbah has stated that the Akufo-Addo government is on course to restore the country’s economic stability and growth that existed before the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic.Addressing the press at the party headquarters in Aslym Down, Accra, today Wednesday 22 February 2023, Richard Ahiagbah, said the government’s Post Covid-19 Program for Economic Growth (PC-PEG) is a solid blueprint that is ushering the country out of the economic setback the people of Ghana have had to endure the last 12months.NDC’s poor recordBefore he outlined the recovery plans of the Akufo-Addo administration, Mr. Ahiagbah, took a swipe at the opposition National Democratic Congress (NDC) for what he says is a deliberate effort on the part of the opposition party to “misled many Ghanaians to think that [the Akufo-Addo government] has mismanaged the economy since assuming office”.“This claim by the NDC however is not supported by the hard economic data and the reality around the world. In all these, the NDC has not provided any credible alternative solution(s). They are talking a lot but not about solutions.  It is blame, mischaracterization, and denial of obvious global economic realities” Richard Ahiagbah said. Supporting his argument on the “poor performance” of the NDC when they were in office between 2013 and 2016, Ahiagbah said, “on the larger economy which is measured in terms of GDP the NDC, supervised a perpetual decline from 2013 to 2016”.“In 2013, GDP was 7.3%; in 2014 it was 4%; in 2015 it was 3.9% and in 2016 it was 3.7%. In terms of percentage changes in the GPD, the economy deteriorated by 45.2% in 2014 compared to 2013 growth. Similarly, the economy decreased by 2.5% in 2015 and 5.12% in 2016.“In the Real Sector, which includes Agriculture, Industry, and Service, the NDC’s performance was even worst. From 2013, real sector growth plummeted significantly across all sectors. In 2014 all the sectors grew at a negative rate using 2013 performance as a base” Mr. Ahiagbah said.“Let me remind you that this poor performance was against the NDC inheriting an economy that had discovered oil in commercial quantities and began production in 2010; which shot Ghana’s GDP to 14% in 2011.  All that growth momentum was vanquished by the NDC, led by Ex-President Mahama” he added. NPP’s outstanding performanceComparing the NDC’s performance with the NPP’s time in office before the COVID-19 pandemic and the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the NPP’s director of communications noted that available data shows that the “NPP turned around the contracting economy it inherited from the NDC in 2017 to date”.“On GDP, 2017 GDP grew at 8.1 percent compared to 3.7 percent in 2016, 2018 GDP grew by 6.3%, 2019 GDP grew by 6.5% and 2020 GDP grew by 0.5%. In the real rector, the industry recorded its highest growth of 16.7% in 2017, with Agriculture at 8.4%, and the Services sectors at 4.3%.“Industry grew from a mournful negative 0.5% in 2016 to 16.7 percent in 2017 and Services grew from 2.8% in 2016 to an appreciable 4.3% in 2017,” Ahiagbah said.“The Agric sector also grew from a dismal 2.7% in 2016 to 8.4% in 2017. Friends from the media, this data we just reviewed imply that the vulnerable in our society, the poor, indeed, the vast majority of Ghanaians fared much better under NPP in 2017. Data is sacred” he added.Recovery planAs part of the recovery plan, Mr. Ahiagbah said “Government has introduced the Post Covid-19 Program for Economic Growth (PC-PEG) to among others establish a sustainable macro-fiscal path, restore debt sustainability and macro-economic stability underpinned by key structural reform and social protection”.According to Richard Ahiagbah, “the PC-PEG will address the economic challenges of this country through fiscal consolidation, get treatment, and structural reform” and that “Government through the Central Bank has responded with a raft of monetary policy measures, including the bi-weekly FX forward auction, and the BDC forex auction which has helped subdue the pressure on the spot FX market”.“To complement the monetary policies which have been activated, the Government has subsequently announced Expenditure-led measures including a 30% cut in discretionary expenditures, a moratorium on the new creation of government units, a freeze on government travels, 30 percent cut in salaries of the executive and political appointees, among others,” Ahiagbah said.“Other policies such as the implementation of the Gold for Oil (G4O) program, implementation of the COVID-19 Alleviation & Revitalization of Enterprises Support (CARES) Program, to inject some Ghc100 billion into the economy” [are all part of the larger strategy of the government to the country’s economic stability] Ahiagbah added.“Government’s transformative agenda to digitalize the economy [which is aimed at formalizing] the Ghanaian economy & improve its administrative systems & global competitiveness, the banking sector reforms which has introduced a tighter regulatory & supervisory framework in the sector are all part of the steps government is taking to revive the economy.“Through these innovative measures, the government is demonstrating its resolve to build back the economy quickly and restore fiscal rectitude. Government’s commitment to these measures is a clear assurance that we are on the right track and capable of causing a turnaround of the economy with the resolute support of all Ghanaians” Richard Ahiagbah further stated.Way Forward for EconomyIn his press statement, the NPP's director of communications identified several thematic areas that the government is paying attention to tackle the prevailing economic challenges.Mr. Ahiagbah noted that in 2022, the government introduced a raft of fiscal and monetary measures to rein in expenditures and improve revenue mobilization, including a cut in discretionary spending, a cut in the salaries of the executives, a freeze on foreign travel, among others"".""The 2023 budget indicates the government’s desire to continue fiscal consolidation efforts and reduce the fiscal deficit in line with the pending IMF Programme. The government expects to record one of the lowest deficits this year, much lower than the GH¢64.0 billion announced in the 2023 budget"" Ahiagbah said.""Expenditure measures, the debt treatment program, and structural reforms, among others, are all measures that the Akufo-Addo administration has embarked on to ensure that the economy is stabilized and subsequently made to grow as was the case before the COVID-19 pandemic"" Ahiagbah added."
54,'We've beaten him twice' - NPP unperturbed by Mahama's 3rd coming - Ahiagbah,"The Director of Communications of the governing New Patriotic Party (NPP) has stated that the party is unperturbed by the decision of former president John Dramani Mahama to run for president in the 2024 general elections.Richard Ahiagbah told press men (February 22) that having defeated Mahama twice (in 2016 and 2020), the NPP has no fears facing him for a third consecutive time.“We have beaten him twice, so you just conclude for yourself if we are afraid of him. It is all mathematical, and we have defeated him twice. He is even afraid to plainly declare whether he is going to contest or not. We are ready for him.”According to Ahiagbah, the NPP's major preoccupation now is to improve the economy and ease the cost of living crisis that citizens have been faced with for the past few months.“We are interested in how we can build our economy, and we want to know whether he has the solution because we saw him vanquish the gains that he got, and we saw him collapse our economy and banking sector. ""He doesn’t have what it takes to improve Ghana because if he had what it took to do that, he wouldn’t have vanquished our economic gains and taken us to the IMF,” he stressed.Mahama declares bid, picks nomination formsMahama's formal intention to run for a third consecutive shot at the presidency was reported when a number of NDC MPs confirmed that he was going to contest.On February 22, forms were picked on his behalf by Prof. Alabi and regional chairmen amid fanfare. Mahama is expected to address the media in due course to formally announce his bid.Mahama’s political roots date as far back to the days of Ghana’s independence when his father served in the Nkrumah government.John Mahama, a political throughbred He is reputed to be one of the most thoroughbred politicians of the Fourth Republic having served from the local level (Assembly) through to becoming a Member of Parliament for Bole Bamboi on the ticket of the National Democratic Congress.Mahama held deputy minister and ministerial portfolios under the Rawlings government before rising to become vice president under John Mills and president when he took over from Mills then won his first full term in 2012.He is widely expected to contest for the presidency come 2024 as he seeks a final term in office on the back of two straight defeats to President Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo in 2016 and 2020.Meanwhile, catch the latest GhanaWeb TV Election Desk interview with Francis Addai-Nimoh, as he discusses his plans to become the NPP's flagbearer, below:You can also watch this episode of People & Places here:SARA"

57,We need Kyerematen to break the eight – Nana Busia,"Nana Adom Busia, a leading member of the New Patriotic Party (NPP) in the Wenchi constituency of the Bono Region, says endorsing Alan Kwadwo Kyerematen as a presidential candidate will enhance NPP’s chances to break the eight in the Election 2024.He, therefore, called on the delegates, preparing for the party’s impending presidential primaries to remember and ‘stick’ to the NPP’s tradition and give Alan Kyeremanten the nod to lead the party to election victory.In an interview with the Ghana News Agency (GNA) at Wenchi, Nana Busia said the NPP would be ungrateful to Alan Kyerematen, if the delegates failed to endorse him, saying “that will also cause doom for our great party”.He said Alan Kyeremanten had remained loyal, and served the NPP wholeheartedly, after conceding defeat to President Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo in the party’s last presidential primaries, stressing “we all know this is time for Alan Kyeremanten to lead us to retain political power in the next general election”.“For us to break the eight, I think Vice President Dr Alhaji Mahamudu Bawumia has contributed his quota, and it’s appropriate for him to retire with President Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo”.“His retirement with the president will build and strengthen the internal unity we need to go for the elections. Other than that, it will be politically suicidal for the NPP in the 2024 general election”, he added.Describing him as the choice for all, Nana Busia said “as a great party we can’t overlook our political history and pick any wrong choice to lead us because posterity would not spare us if we do so”."
58,Ofori-Atta ‘abon’ – Yaa Jantuah slams NPP over economic mess,"The General Secretary of the Convention People’s Party (CPP), Nana Yaa Jantuah has hit hard at the NPP government for keeping Finance Minister, Ken Ofori-Atta, in office months after the country’s economy deteriorated.The former Public Affairs Director for the Public Utilities Regulatory Commission (PURC) who was speaking on Power FM’s Inside Politics programme wondered why the minister was still in office after Ghana borrowed so hugely in a debt distress level.“Ken Ofori-Atta abon [Ken Ofori-Atta is incompetent],” she said in Akan while explaining that the finance minister is highly incompetent and unintelligent for allowing the economy to slowly grind to a halt amid warnings from experts.“When I call them F9 (unintelligent) ministers people want to come after me but that is who they are: non-performing ministers,” she argued.Yaa Jantuah said times are hard that the working class and the ordinary people cannot afford a 3 square meal which was possible before the NPP took over power in 2017.The hardship, she explained, was as a result of the inflationary spiral fuelled by a steep depreciation of the cedi which was not managed for a long time.To her, President Akufo-Addo should have sacked Ofori-Atta long before the economy got crushed to a point that the country cannot pay for its domestic and external debts.Experts and rating agents have described Ghana’s economy as one that is in a huge debt crisis.Finding a way to handle the government’s debts internationally, Finance Minister Ofori-Atta recently disclosed that the government has initiated talks with China over Ghana’s debt following a successful Domestic Debt Exchange Programme (DDEP).He told Citi News that negotiations with China are important because China holds the majority of the external bonds, stressing that he was to lead a delegation to China to plead for debt cancellation.“The big elephant in the room is China, we will be visiting China by the end of the week to really discuss how they come into the envelope as quickly as possible. So we are looking at that support from them. China represents about a third of the $5.7 billion loan and so it is important that we engage them,” he said.Nana Yaa Jantuah believes Ghana should not have degraded to a level that a team that mocked the previous government for going for an IMF bailout will now be drowned in debt borne out of mismanagement.He partly blamed the nepotistic nature of President Akufo-Addo who is related to Ofori-Atta for the economic mess which she said had plunged the country into hunger."
59,"Mahama was far superior to this corrupt, inept, and insensitive government – True Drivers Union","The True Drivers Union says the decision to support former President John Dramani Mahama in his quest to contest the 20224 presidential elections is because he is fat competent, credible, and with the highest form of integrity.Public Relations Officer (PRO) Yaw Barimah told Nyankonton Mu Nsem on Rainbow Radio 87.5Fm that the current New Patriotic Party (NPP) has failed its promises to Ghanaians.He noted that in 2016, they supported the NPP and President Akufo-Addo, however, he has failed the people and exhibited high forms of corruption, incompetence, and mismanaged Ghana’s economy.He claimed that the NPP promised to create more jobs and protect the public but has done the opposite.He stated that they are currently destroying businesses and depleting our resources for their own selfish gain.“We expected better leadership from the NPP, but what they have delivered so far shows that Mahama is far better than what Nana Addo has delivered,” Yaw Barimah said. We had disagreements with Mahama when he was in power. But based on what we’ve seen so far, from Nana Addo, we’ll conclude that he’s clueless, incompetent, and lacks the qualifications to be president”.When asked if they were not doing this because they are NDC members, he recalled how they supported the NPP in 2016 and was asked if they were NPP members at the time.“We had a better life under Mahama. He far outperformed Nana Addo. Today is difficult for us. We have come to regret voting for the NPP. Ghanaians are currently facing economic hardship. Ghanaians are struggling. ""We cannot afford the high cost of gasoline. Things are challenging. Businesses are struggling. We know that supporting Mahama is the best option. We’ve seen what he’s capable of because we’ve seen what he’s capable of. That is why we have decided to back him,” he added."

They indicated that they are now suffering particularly because of the increase in the prices of petroleum products which is making it difficult for them to ply their trade and has led to a lot of them losing their jobs.Some of the Okada drivers who spoke to JoyNews said that John Mahama is the right person to lead the country out of the current economic challenges.They added that they want the former president to lead Ghana again because he promised to legalise Okada when he becomes president.“I’m taking part in this because of the promise of former President John Dramani Mahama to legalise Okada in 2020 but unfortunately, he did not win the election. We believe that in 2024 John Mahama will win the elections. We are pleading with him to come out and pick the forms (NDC flagebearship nomination forms),” one Okada driver said.“We are on our knees begging him to go for the forms.

66,Big names don't win elections - Francis Addai-Nimoh on NPP flagbearer race,"Francis Addai-Nimoh has shot down claims that big names in politics give people an advantage over their peers in any political race. According to the flagbearer-hopeful of the ruling New Patriotic Party (NPP), although it appears some of the personalities who have also indicated their intentions to run for the vacant role in the party are ‘bigger’ than him, that is not what will win them the elections. He explained that it takes such attributes as character and endearment to be able to win the hearts of the delegates of the party. “Big names do not win elections. Elections are won by your character, by your good self – endearing yourself to the electorates, articulating your vision and they having the acceptability for you that you could be, and you are qualified to be their leader; not necessarily any name as such,” he explained. Speaking with GhanaWeb TV’s Etsey Atisu in an interview on Election Desk, Francis Addai-Nimoh recalled how, for instance, he out-performed many more experienced names in the party during the 2014 presidential primaries of the NPP. He said that because of the confidence the delegates have in him, he came out third in that race, even though he was regarded as the underdog in the race. “Similarly, in 2014, when the seven contestants, and I was one of them, I was seen to be the underdog; I was seen to be someone unknown in the political environment of our country. The other six contestants had all worked under J. A. Kufuor’s administration either as ministers of state, or deputy ministers of state, and Addai-Nimoh had not been in that position before. “But when we went through that process in 2014, I came in third, which was an enviable position that I secured for myself, and that shows the potential that the NPP delegates found in me and then encouraged me to make progress with this ambition,” he added. The former Member of Parliament for Mampong also shared some other reasons why he is vying for the flagbearer position of the NPP again. Watch more below:AE/OGB"

Dr Butakor said he is an indigene and grassroots person who is well-known across the constituency adding that his experience coupled with humility, connectedness and resourcefulness will be able to attract floating voters and votes of the majority of disgruntled NPP supporters due to the abysmal performance of the NPP over the years. According to him, he will leverage his experience at home and abroad to influence policies that will impact the economic fortunes of the constituency, especially in the area of employment, education, health and infrastructure. He appealed to delegates of the NDC to trust him with their votes since he is the right person to wrestle power from the NPP and lead to total dominance of the NDC in the constituency.Dr Butakor currently teaches Quantitative Research Methods, Educational Measurement and Assessment, and Statistics at both undergraduate and graduate levels.He holds PhD (Measurement, Evaluation, and Statistics) from the University of Alberta, Canada; an MSc in Applied Statistics from Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology; as well as MSc in Educational Sciences, from the University of Groningen, The Netherlands.The Nsawam-Adoagyiri constituency was created out of the Aburi-Nsawam constituency in the Eastern Region of Ghana.

Adomako Mensah claims the party has been determining the psoition that the Minority Caucus takes on governmental issues before they can decide on the next course of action.In an interview with Wontumi TV, he suggested that measures should be taken to prevent the party's leadership from meddling in parliamentary duties since doing so would interfere with the administration's ability to function effectively.“Now we all know that the NDC party is run by the headquarters. Every morning, Fifi Kwetey will write a letter and direct that all of you should toe this line. “They did the same thing to Huruna. They sacked him. All of us know that there was no NEC meeting, nothing, and they removed them.“First vetting of the new leadership…then the General Secretary writes a letter that they shouldn’t accept all of the nominees.“So, it has become very clear that the party is being run from the headquarters including the MPs. That’s my worry, if we don’t take care, Adabraka, the party’s head office might have so much influence. “Don’t forget that the current chairman of the party sits on the parliamentary service board…I mean that kind of conflict of interest is very strange…you can imagine Aseidu Nketia’s contributions during their council meeting. “So, as I said, the party is being run from the headquarters, Aseidu Nketia and Fifi Kwetey, write letters and direct them on what they should do,” he added.

Madam Hayibor, who is a former Research Assistant interacting with the media, said the NDC was the best Party in developing the Hohoe Constituency as well as the nation in general and she was ready to carry the mantle. “Having more women in decision-making rooms such as parliament had significantly improved our economy and the world.” “Decision-making is always better when women are at the table, and this is also essential for the functioning and effective democracy.” She said she had served the Party in the Constituency, region and nation, while also being an active party member abroad. Madam Hayibor said she had fulfilled all her financial obligations to the Party in the quest for her development of the Party at home.   She noted that politics was a tool for development, and it was time for the youth to be part of the development and must play active roles to support the adults.  Madam Hayibor said contributing her quota to the Party in the Constituency was borne out of the experiences she acquired through her political life.  She said she believed the economic empowerment of women, which could be secured through laws, can help solve the global economic crisis, especially in Ghana and the world at large. Madam Hayibor said her position as a Women Organiser of the Party in Scotland led to the adoption of party Branches in the Hohoe Constituency for support as well as played key roles in the 2020 general elections in Hohoe. “I believe one of the ways to stand up for the marginalised in societies is to join the discussion tables and represent the views of the minorities and be the voice for the voiceless in society.”"

Alan Kyerematen also noted that a change of government in 2025 could jeopardise such laudable policies as the Free SHS, 1D1F, PFJ, Agenda 111, which are beneficial to the people of Ghana.He sought the wise counsel of the Yaa Naa to advise NPP delegates in the region to do the right thing by selecting him as flagbearer so that he can lead the NPP to the historic task of 'breaking the eight' in 2024, which will be a first in the 4th Republic. Citing the sterling record of Alan in government, and his belief that the astute politician would continue, as president, to serve the country well, the Yaa Naa clothed him with a pure white smock, a hat in NPP colours, and gifted him a pure white ram, yams and cola. These, traditionally, are signs of victory in Dagbon.

Francis Addai-Nimoh, has advised Finance Minister Ken Ofori-Atta that transparency is key to winning the hearts of Ghanaians as the country continues to grapple with a debt crisis.In an interview with Don Kwabena Prah on Happy 98.9 FM’s “Epa Hoa Daben” socio-political talk show, the former Member of Parliament called on Ken Ofori-Atta, to provide data to support the Domestic Debt Exchange Programme (DDEP), which requires pensioners and other bondholders to contribute to resolving Ghana’s debt crisis.Ing. Addai-Nimoh urged the Finance Minister to compare the number of pensioners who have government bonds and the quantum of their investment with the investments of other financial institutions, such as banks and insurance companies.“At the beginning, my position on the issue was for the Finance Minister to provide the number of pensioners who have government bonds. Then the quantum of their investment. It was later that I realized the investment was around 2.2b. So compare that figure with the others, the banks, the insurance companies, and others. Then ask what the effect will be if the pensioners are exempted or added. “For me, it was just simple,” he said.However, Ing. Addai-Nimoh stressed the importance of transparency in the decision-making process, saying that the Finance Minister needs to provide the public with the necessary information so they can make informed decisions and trustIng. Addai-Nimoh believes that if the Finance Minister can provide the public with the necessary information, Ghanaians will be more willing to support efforts to address the country’s debt crisis. Ultimately, transparency will be key to winning the hearts of Ghanaians, according to the aspiring flagbearer of the NPP.“When he said we needed to help him for him to help us, that was a good statement. But then submit the spare sheets with the figures, bring them to the public so that we can understand why pensioners are in there, and with that, we can determine where the effects are insignificant or not. “Without it, they can’t trust you,” he said.“They have been exempted, and it’s refreshing to know, but we shouldn’t have dragged this issue to where we go.” The figures should have been provided so we know how much the financial institutions and their investments in government bonds total. So, if we decide to exempt pensioners and the consequences are minimal and we can still manage the debt situation, why not exempt them? “”Since they’ve been exempted, I’d commend them for standing their ground and expressing their displeasure,” he added."

84,Bawumia suffered attacks but we’re enjoying fruits of his sacrifices – NPP MP,"Member of Parliament (MP) for Akim Swedru Constituency, Kennedy Osei Nyarko, has mounted a spirited justification for Vice President Dr. Mahamudu Bawumia to be elected flagbearer of the New Patriotic Party (NPP).The lawmaker and former Deputy Minister of Agriculture opined that Dr. Bawumia’s sacrifices and contributions to the party amid attacks and vilification by both the opposition and government are sufficient grounds for him to lead the governing party into the 2024 elections.“He led our 2016 campaign and received all the attacks from our opponents and won us power with a historical margin. He is still receiving attacks for the party and government, and you think I should sidestep him? All the current attacks from the opposition parties are being directed at him just because he has decided to sacrifice himself for the party,” he wrote on Facebook.Kennedy Osei forcefully stated that there are positions being occupied and enjoyed by government appointees under President Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo that are the results of the sacrifices of Dr. Bawumia, whom he further described as the nemesis of the opposition National Democratic Congress.""Many are today holding different portfolios and positions in this Government because of the work he did for the party then in opposition in 2016. He singlehandedly took the entire NDC government on, both in opposition and in government, so no wonder they are after his head and would prefer that he not be on the NPP’s ticket. He is the greatest nemesis of the biggest opposition party,” he added.This latest endorsement by the Akim Swedru MP adds up to the overwhelming number of NPP parliamentarians who have thrown their weight behind the Vice President ahead of the party’s presidential primaries.Though Dr. Mahamudu Bawumia has not officially declared his intentions to be president, Dr. Gideon Boako, a spokesperson for the Vice President, has stated that the official announcement will be made if the party opens nominations for the primaries.You can also watch this episode of People & Places here:"
85,NPP stockpiling money to win 2024 elections – Prof. Kofi Asiedu alleges,"The Central Regional Chairman of the opposition National Democratic Congress (NDC), Prof. Richard Kofi Asiedu, is claiming that the collapse of banks by the government shows that the governing New Patriotic Party (NPP) is hoarding money to win the 2024 parliamentary and presidential elections.He says money will be used to persuade voters to vote in their favor, but he also says the NDC will take power from the NPP with unity.“NPP will use huge amounts of money in the 2024 general elections to buy votes from electorates but will lose massively in both parliamentary and presidential elections because voters will collect the money and vote against the ruling party,” he disclosed.Prof. Kofi Asiedu made the claim during the groundbreaking ceremony for the construction of an ultra-modern party office in the Abura Asebu Kwamankese (AKK) constituency, as the party in the Central Region launched operation 20 parliamentary seats.He called on Ghanaians and all the NDC members to come together and work hard for the party to win power in 2024.“Removing the NPP from power is a communal labour and not only [the labor of] party executives, and I strongly believe the NDC is moving forward for victory,” Prof. Kofi Asiedu urged.Prof. Kofi Asiedu charged all NDC members, including party executives, never to scam or defraud anyone in the name of the NDC, threatening to expel anyone engaging in such criminal acts.“The negative nature of your actions and attitude will have a negative effect on the party,” Prof. Kofi Asiedu stated.Prof Nana Ama Browne Klutse, a senior lecturer in the Department of Physics at the University of Ghana, who is running for the Abura Asebu Kwamankese (AKK) constituency parliamentary seat, contributed 50 bags of cement to the party's office construction.She charged all NDC members to be vigilant during the counting of the ballot papers to enable the party to win the 2024 general elections.Prof. Browne Klutse appealed to NDC members to forgive one another and join hands to win the AAK seat as well as more seats in the Central Region and the country at large.You can also watch this episode of People & Places here:"
86,I constructed Kumasi Kejetia Market so I’m loved in Ashanti Region - Kojo Bonsu,"Former Mayor of Kumasi, Kojo Bonsu, has said that Kumasi market women and the Ashanti Region love him because he constructed the Kumasi Kejetia Market Phase 1 for them.Speaking on Asempa FM's Ekosii Sen, Kojo Bonsu said many people did not believe the construction of the market was possible, but he did it.“When I go to the market, the market women praise me; they say ‘you are the one we like’ and they praise me for the Kejetia market,” he told Osei Bonsu OB.He explained that many people thought the project was not feasible, and the market women resisted relocation, but he managed to fence the place one night. According to him, the work had started by the time they came.Kojo Bonsu has also said that the party can only win the 2024 general elections with him as the lead candidate and win the Ashanti Region.He said the NDC’s bane over the years has been the votes from the Ashanti Region and he is the best person to curb that.“If I become the flagbearer of the party, the NDC will secure a lot of votes in the Ashanti region. This means I will break the monopoly and split the votes NPP secures in the region. Even today, the market women at Central Market and Kejetia Market are all supporting my presidential bid. The women have said that if I become the leader of the party, they will all vote for me.”“Today they see the vision and plan to develop Kumasi that we had,” he said.Kumasi Youth Association (KUYA) in 2016 awarded Kojo Bonsu for standing out among all former Mayors of the Kumasi Metropolitan Assembly.According to the group, the innovation of the former mayor gave birth to the famous Rattray Park, Kejetia Market and renovated Prempeh Assembly Hall among other equally important monumental infrastructural projects in Kumasi.You can also watch this episode of People & Places here:"

90,Mahama is making empty promises - Moshake,"A former executive of the Tema East constituency branch of the opposition National Democratic Congress (NDC), Stephen Ashitey Adjei, has accused former President Mahama of using empty promises of juicy appointments to deceive gurus of the party.In the latest of his writings on happenings in the party, Mr. Ashitey Adjei, who is popularly called Moshake, accused the former President of secretly enticing some leading figures of the party with ministerial appointments to win them over.“It is not only Ministerial appointments, even the running mate position, Mr. Mahama is playing lotto with it by promising multiple people that he will make them running Mate,” Moshake wrote.The accusation is the latest by Moshake who has been rubbing Mr. Mahama’s nose into his past mistakes which he says led to the NDC losing power twice in 2016 and 2020.His write-up which is one in a series that he has been putting out since 2020 comes as the NDC slowly builds up toward a congress to elect its flagbearer for the 2024 presidential election.Like all other salvos that Moshake has released, this one is bound to rub Mr. Mahama sore because of the facts that Moshake characteristically laces with his punches.and the write-up is coming at a time that many in the NDC are tired of the Mahama brand and are looking for a fresh face to lead the NDC which has been under the Mahama influence since 2012.The former constituency executive accuses Mr. Mahama of, “promising positions like confetti to NDC gurus just to win their favour for the upcoming presidential primary.”However, he vows that, “no empty promise will yield the loyalties of anybody because every single person in the NDC knows how neglectful John Mahama is. We remember how Mahama snubbed NDC members and appointed strangers like Raymond Atuguba, Nayong Billy Joe Alhassan Azong and others when he became president.”He called on, “all the executives that Mahama has promised the positions to reject his indecent proposal out of hand to show him he John Mahama cannot deceive any NDC guru with the promise of position.”Meanwhile, Moshake has urged the party’s delegates to, “get with the wind of change and vote massively for Dr. Kwabena Duffuor to lead the party in 2024.”"

92,Adwoa Safo makes first appearance in parliament for 2023," Member of Parliament for Dome Kwabenya, Sarah Adwoa Safo has made her first appearance in parliament since the House resumed sitting on February 7, 2023. The third session of the eighth Parliament resumed on February 7, 2023, after the house went on break for Christmas and new festivities. Following the resumption of the house, Adwoa Safo did not make any appearance in the chamber even though she was in the country. Adwoa Safo’s absence from parliament was one of the most discussed topics in the country in 2022. The discussion came on the back of her leaving the country after the 2022 budget was passed on November 26, 2021. However, on November 11 2022, Adwoa Safo officially resumed her parliamentary duties following her return from the United States of America. Speaker of Parliament, Alban Bagbin, on October 26, 2022, ruled that the report of the committee set up to look into her case and that of two other MPs who absented themselves for a number of sittings should be presented before the whole house for a debate. Alban Bagbin dismissed the objection of the Majority Leader, Osei Kyei-Mensah-Bonsu, to the admissibility of the committee report for the consideration of the house. “As I have noted in this ruling, the decision (sic) on not to admit a motion is the exclusive preserve of the Speaker. In view of the foregoing, the House is well within its right to receive and consider reports of the committee and make a determination arising out of the consideration. “In the circumstances, it is my ruling that the motion was rightfully admitted and the report of the committee is subject to the consideration of the house. It goes without saying that the (sic) objection of the Majority Leader today (sic) is hereby dismissed…” he concluded his verdict. YNA/KPE"
93,NPP Presidential Primaries: Alan’s camp wants early congress,"The Campaign Team of Mr Alan Kyerematen, a flagbearer hopeful of the New Patriotic Party (NPP) has urged the Party to hold its presidential primaries early to offer the prospective leader adequate time to prepare for the 2024 general election. The Team has also appealed to the Party’s leadership to allow aspirants to campaign ahead of the date for the primaries to offer them enough time to engage with delegates. In an interview with the Ghana News Agency, Mr Yaw Buaben Asamoa, Spokesperson for Mr Kyerematen’s Campaign, said the Camp would prefer the presidential primaries to be held in either August or September this year. “We believe that the earlier the date, the better. If we are to succeed ourselves as an administration, then it is important that we have the next potential President early so that the President can influence public policy going forward,” he said. Mr Asamoa said if elected earlier, the flagbearer would have the opportunity to make input in the priorities and budgets of the Government in a manner that would positively affect the chances of the Party in the next general election. He said the Party’s delegates also needed enough time to meet with the aspirants and assess their capabilities, hence the need for the Party to allow the aspirants to campaign ahead of their nomination. “If the nomination process is delaying because the Party cannot fix the date for the election, then it is difficult for the candidate and the Party itself because that space could be filled with activity between delegates and potential candidates,” Mr Asamoa said. The NPP is yet to announce a date for its presidential and parliamentary primaries. The Party’s National Council met in Accra earlier this month to decide on the date for the primaries, but the meeting was reported to have ended inconclusively. The Party said it would engage broadly on the issue to arrive at a consensus. Per the NPP’s Constitution, the Party must elect its presidential candidate 11 months before the general election, when it is in power. Mr Kyerematen, who has been working towards becoming President since 207, resigned as Minister of Trade and Industry last month to pursue his presidential ambition. He officially announced his decision to contest the NPP flagbearership race in an address on January 10, 2023. In that address, Mr Kyerematen said the country required a new plan to build a self-reliant economy to avoid going back to the International Monetary Fund in future. He said if he succeeded in his quest to become President in the next general election, he would launch and lead the execution of the Great Transformational Plan of Ghana, which would span the period 2025 to 2030 to revamp key sectors of the economy. Mr Asamoa said Mr Kyerematen had so far toured the Ashanti, Bono East, Bono, Ahafo, Western North, Volta, and Eastern regions, where he met chiefs and delegates to officially inform them about his decision to contest the NPP flagbearership race. “Everywhere we have been, there is the feeling that Mr Kyerematen is the right man in the right place for the right job,” he said."
94,Ketu North NDC primaries: Businessman to contest Edem Agbana for Avedzi's seat,"Mr. Gabriel Kwamigah-Atokple Tanko, a businessperson and National Welfare Committee member of the National Democratic Congress (NDC), is lacing his boots to make a second attempt at the Parliamentary primaries of the party in the Ketu North Constituency. He contested the primaries in 2019 but lost to incumbent Dr James Klutse Avedzi. The aspirant, who has been touring the various branches of the NDC in the constituency ahead of the party’s Presidential and Parliamentary primaries slated for May, this year, made his intentions known in an interview with the Ghana News Agency at Dzodze. According to the business executive and professional who has served in various capacities in the NDC both in the Ketu North Constituency and at the national level and a member of the Volta and Ketu North Finance Committees of the party, he was compelled by the dream to usher in a new dawn for the NDC in Ketu North. The hopeful as affectionately called Tanko as he is affectionately believes there can be no better replacement for the incumbent Member of Parliament (MP) Dr. James Klutse Avedzi who has hinted of his decision not to run for the position again, than him (Tanko).  “My passion and effort to contribute to the development of our constituency is paramount- the evidence can be seen across the Constituency since my civil service days- I am ready and prepared for the job like no other,” he said. Mr Tanko, who is sure of winning the Ketu North NDC parliamentary primaries, intends to unite the party when he wins the constituency and national election.The seat is being eyed by Edem Agbana, the immediate past deputy National Communications officer of the party.  He advised all parliamentary primary hopefuls against a campaign of insults, attacks, and acrimony, which sometimes characterised political competitions and called for a change of the status quo. “It’s imperative that we avoid politics of insults and attacks on one another and rather focus on the messages we have as aspirants for the Branch Executives in the interest of peace and harmony going forward,” he advised. Mr Tanko said his tour of the constituency affirms his commitment of prosecuting an issue-based campaign devoid of character assassinations, and all other unhealthy discourses that may frustrate intended reconciliation activities after the elections in the Ketu North constituency. “The gate of my house remains open to all NDC faithful, who truly seek the progress of our beloved constituency,” Tanko added as he campaigns on a message of  “New Dawn” (NUBUKƐ)."
95,NPP needs to do extraordinary to break the 8 – Ntim,"The national chairman of the ruling New Patriotic Party(NPP), Stephen Ntim, has said that the party will have to perform exceptionally to win the upcoming 2024 election.According to him, the party is poised to make history by retaining power beyond the eight-year rule by a political party under the Fourth Republic.“We are seeking to do something no political party in the history of this country has been able to do. We are seeking to win a third consecutive general election. We are seeking to break the eight that has so far eluded the two major political parties in the fourth republic.“Obviously, to achieve this extraordinary and unprecedented feat, we need to do the extraordinary. We cannot do the same things we’ve been doing from 1992 and expect to achieve a different result, more so, when the result in question, is one that no political party in Ghana has been able to achieve. This consciousness is what I expect to drive our 2024 project. We must all be conscious of the enormity of the task ahead of us to be able to work our hearts out towards its realization,” Chairman Ntim said while addressing a Retreat by the Council of Elders of the Greater Accra Region branch of the party at Peduase in Aburi.He added that the target of the current national executives is to ensure victory for the NPP come 2024 and nothing will stop them from achieving this objective.“Consistent with our mandate, we, as national officers, following our election in July 2022, set for ourselves, a target of working assiduously to retain power in 2024 to justify the confidence that had been reposed in us by the party’s delegates. This particular commitment to delivering nothing but victory to the party come 2024, has, at all times, been our primary focus in everything we do.”"
96,COVID-19 inflows exceed US$3 billion IMF bailout – NDC woman wrongly claims,"Ohemaa Borngreat, a member of the National Democratic Congress (NDC) communication team, has berated President Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo’s administration over its misuse of funds it mobilized to fight the COVID-19 pandemic.She claimed in an interview with TV XYZ that the administration completely misappropriated over 20 billion (cedis) which is equivalent to one million five hundred ninety thousand four hundred fifty-seven dollars monies raised to combat the Covid-19 outbreak and is now seeking just 3 billion dollars from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) by way of the financial bailout. which her claim is false. She made these remarks while reacting to the government’s decision to include certain individuals in its domestic debt exchange programme. “By God’s grace, Covid is not a blessing but it is a blessing in disguise because when Covid came Ghanaians had a lot of benefits from the Covid. “So, if you’re a prudent government, couldn't you have invested the Covid money and we wouldn’t have even been here chasing the IMF for just 3 billion. “Whereby you had over 21 billion from the Covid fund. What did you do with the money? The Ministry of Information paid over 1.51 billion old cedis to themselves as risk allowance. So, the government has no vision for us,” she said. Meanwhile, the Minister of Finance, Ken Ofori-Atta, has calmed the nerves of pensioner bondholders, insisting that the government will not shortchange their legitimate rights but will honour their coupon payments and maturing principals, like all government bondholders.He told Parliament that the government remained committed to the well-being and dignity of the senior citizens and pensioners.On the other hand, President Akufo-Addo has also stated that the government’s debt exchange programme (DEP) was fraught with several challenges after its announcement, but it has largely been accepted by the citizenry.He made this known when the German Federal Minister of Finance, Christian Lindner, paid him a visit at the Jubilee House. The government has also announced 85% subscription rate for the DDEP which faced stiff challenges from a range of bondholders.AM/SARA"
97,NPP bigwigs kicked me out of parliament in a mafia style – Former Kwadaso MP cries,"Former Member of Parliament (MP) for Kwadaso Constituency Mr Samiu Kwadwo Nuamah has expressed disappointment in the New Patriotic Party (NPP) for playing mafia tactics in his constituency to unseat him during the 2020 elections.According to Mr Kwadwo Nuamah, his removal from the seat in the constituency was orchestrated by some bigwigs of the New Patriotic Party (NPP) at its headquarters in Accra.“People felt I had no political background so they decided to remove me from the seat by hook or crook. He has no Godfather, that’s all. So they do all those evil and call it Mafia. And somebody speak out with joy to say we have played him mafia.” Mr Kwadwo Nuamah told Kwame Tanko on Angel FM Kumasi in an interview monitored by MyNewsGH.com.He further revealed that, the source of such power struggle in the party is mostly the fight between an MP and CEO of a government agency.“The issue of fight between CEO and MPs is very brutal, and it brings some kind of hatred to you. A typical example is myself. I was in the UK, sold my house, came down and did campaign. I had a 90% win in the constituency which is unprecedented, that after elections, every 9 people out of 10 will vote for you, it has never happened. The party should have even contacted me and learn how I was able to do that”, Mr Kwadwo Nuamah narrated.The former lawmaker indicated that in most cases, people who are engaged in such mafia style do not build proper relationship with the party people at the grassroots.In the 2016 Parliamentary election in Kwadaso Constituency in the Ashanti Region, Hon Samiu Kwadwo Nuamah polled 61,631 representing 90.0% while the NDC candidate Monica Bawuah had 6,263 representing 9.2% of the total votes cast.In 2004 NPP candidate had, 83.2 with NDC 13.6, 2008 NPP polled 82.7% NDC 15.3%, whiles in 2012 the NPP Had 83.6% and polling NDC 14.5%.Mr Kwadwo Nuamah was succeeded by incumbent MP for the constituency Dr. Kingsley Nyarko in 2020."
98,Give us list of eligible voters on your database – NDC to NIA,"The main opposition National Democratic Congress is challenging the National Identification Authority (NIA) to publish the number of eligible voters on its database.According to the NDC, this will enable the party to know the total number of people eligible to vote in the December 7, 2024 general elections.The Electoral Commission (EC) has insisted that its decision to make the Ghanacard the sole document for the registration of voters for the 2024 elections remains unchanged.The National Identification Authority (NIA) says it had so far captured about 17 million Ghanaians into its system after the officials of the EC had met them and said a backlog of 400,000 Ghanaians was yet to receive their cards after registration.The NDC is of the view that as it stands the NIA’s claims that it has issued 17 million cards hence the Ghana card should be made the sole document for the acquisition of a voter’s Identity card is untenable.The former deputy Communications Officer for the Ashanti Regional NDC office, Kweku Asafu Adjei, threw this challenge to the NIA to publish the data of eligible voters in an interview on the Ghana Yensom morning show hosted by Odehyeeba Kofi Essuman on Accra 100.5 FM on Friday, February 17, 2023.He stressed that foreigners, as well as minors aged 15 were allowed to register for Ghanacards so it is just fair for the NIA to tell Ghanaians the number of foreigners as well as minors.He said the 17 million people who have had their cards issued to them are all not eligible voters as the NIA is making Ghanaians believe.''It is just right that we know the eligible voters captured in the NIA’s system before the Ghanacard can be made a sole document for the acquisition of the voter's Identity card.He was of the view that not many people have been captured by the NIA and that if the Ghanacard was made the sole document many will be disenfranchised.He revealed that as of now the district offices of the NIA are not operational so people are not getting the opportunity to register for the Ghanacard.He alleged something sinister on the part of the NIA and the EC."

This is not the first time something of this sort is happening, and so we are not perturbed one bit. ""In 2007, when we were preparing for the primaries with over 17 aspirants, all ministers, majority MPs, and MMDCEs all supported Alan Kyerematen. It was only former executives who were supporting Akufo-Addo. But who won? Akufo-Addo won.“Even last year, during the election of the national executives, everyone supported John Boadu, but he eventually lost. ""We are focused, and we are doing our campaign. “So far as it’s not all the 138 MPs that have endorsed him, we are not shaken,”  Hopeson Adorye added."
