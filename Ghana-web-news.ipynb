       "\"The Ashanti Regional Women's Organiser of the National Democratic Congress (NDC), Gloria Huze, has said that the enemy going into the 2024 general elections is not one that is within the party, and as such, her National Women’s Organiser, Dr. Hanna Bissiw, should focus her arsenals elsewhere. Reacting to the statement made by Hanna Bissiw after she, Gloria Huze, picked up nomination forms on behalf of one of the aspirants in the race to become the NDC’s flagbearer, Dr. Kwabena Duffuor. Huze had led some grassroot members of the NDC to pick the forms on behalf of the former Minister of Finance, but had been called out by Hanna Bissiw thereafter, stating that her action was without the support of the national government. “My attention has been drawn to a deplorable and unacceptable action by the Ashanti Regional Women's Organiser, Gloria Huze, in the upcoming flagbearer race. “She is on record to have led a delegation to pick up the nomination form for a Presidential Candidate Aspirant in the name of the Ashanti Regional Women's Wing.“I vehemently and categorically disassociate the wing from her conduct and wish to state emphatically that her conduct is not in any way a representation of any parts of the wing either in the Ashanti Region or across the other 15 regions in the country,” parts of the statement copied to GhanaWeb read.But in a response, Gloria Huze has stated that what she did do so on behalf of the women’s wing of the party.“For the avoidance of doubt and to set the record straight, I led NDC grassroots members whom I was representing, NOT the Ashanti Regional Women’s Wing NOR the Women Wing of our party as it is being alleged.“I have clarified my statement on several platforms including radio stations among others,” she said in a disclaimer. Gloria Huze further stated that while she is quite surprised at the response by Dr. Hanna Bissiw, she expected that the focus would rather be on how the NDC can rather reclaim power from the incumbent New Patriotic Party. She stated that beyond the internal differences they have, she expects that such energies would be directed at their external opponents as the goal is for the party to win power in 2024. She, therefore, apologized for any errors she may have committed, while calling for moderation in the way such matters are handled in the party, so as not to escalate tensions and tear the NDC up from within. “I wish to indicate to all party members that we have a common enemy to gather our arsenals for but not ourselves, irrespective of our preferences in our internal elections. At the end of the day, every one of us is needed at the table and on the field to push our common agenda of removing the NPP from power. This will be critical regardless of our individual preferences. “We should therefore exercise moderation and not attempt to escalate verbal slips to make a whole issue that has the tendency of creating avoidable disunity. Whilst I acknowledge my verbal slips and apologize for whatever inconvenience it might have caused, I believe my clarification should put the matter to rest,” she added. Dr. Kwabena Duffuor has picked up nomination forms to contest the position of the flagbearer of the NDC, and is expecting to face off with the former president of Ghana, John Dramani Mahama.

       "['Broadcaster, Bridget Otoo is puzzled over Kwabena Duffour Jnr’s decision to contest in the National Democratic Congress (NDC) parliamentary primaries despite his unimpressive performance as a leader when he served in different capacities. Duffour Jnr is eyeing the Sekyere Afram Plains seat which is being occupied by NDC’s Alex Adomako Mensah. Dr. Kwabena Duffour Jnr holds a Ph.D. and M.Sc. in Banking and International Finance from Cass Business School, United Kingdom respectively. He has also worked with the Ghana International Bank Plc London - Treasury Department and with Star Assurance Company Limited as an underwriter trainee and now wants to become a politician. Commenting on the development, Bridget Otoo in a tweet, Friday, could not fathom why Duffour Jnr would want to become a parliamentarian when he has on some occasions failed to function as a leader. \"I heard Kwabena Duffour Jnr also wants to go to Parliament? Wow. The guy who held a party the day EIB staff were on strike over unpaid salaries? Such an insensitive person wants to go to parliament. We need better people in politics, not out of touch self-centered people,\" her tweet sighted by GhanaWeb read.“For a moment think about why Kwabena Duffour Jnr wants to go to parliament. He couldn’t manage a bank, can’t pay his staff over mismanagement, holds a party the day his staff are on strike to show them he really doesn’t care. I guess he sees politics as an Opp [opportunity] to be more corrupt,” she stated in another tweet. ',\n",
       " 'Nigerians have gone to the polls today to cast their vote for a president who will replace President Muhammadu Buhari.Three candidates have been tipped as the keen contestants in the race – Peter Obi of the Labour Party (LP), Bola Ahmed Tinubu of the All Progressives Congress (APC), and Atiku Abubakar of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP).Ahead of this, Ghana’s Chair of the Electoral Commission, Jean Mensa spoke to the Ghana Broadcasting Corporation (GBC).According to her, there are similarities between the electoral processes of both countries; Ghana and Nigeria.“There’s a level of similarity with the Ghanaian elections and these processes and systems are geared towards ensuring that the elections are transparent and open and accessible to the stakeholders.“If you look at the biometric verification devices which they call the biometric verification devices which they call the Bimodal Voter Accreditation System (BVAS) where every voter comes in, you will be verified and allowed to wait and in addition to that, they are adopting the open spaces for elections so no longer will elections be held in closed spaces, rooms, classrooms and this is something government has adopted since 1992.“Additionally, they have also adopted the posting of the pink sheet at the various centers. As we know, this was one of the recommendations that came out of the 2012 petition and so now in Ghana we have the pink sheets posted at the various polling stations. So long as your name is on the register and your biometric details are captured on the BVD, you will be allowed to vote in Ghana. Here in Nigeria, if you do not have your PVC card, you will not be allowed to vote,” Jean Mensa said.',\n",
       " 'Dr Jacob Paarechuga Anankware; a Senior Lecturer at the University of Energy and Natural Resources (UENR) has picked nomination forms to contest the National Democratic Congress (NDC) Parliamentary primaries in the Navrongo Central Constituency. The other new face is Pius Ayemva Avio, a legal practitioner and Manager at GRIDConsult.  Dr Anankware is currently the Head of the Department of Horticulture and Crop Production at UNER with over 35 publications in peer-reviewed journals and a book on the hermetic storage of grain against major insects and pests.  Dr Anankware attended the Navrongo Secondary School (NAVASCO) from 2001 to 2004 and proceeded to the University for Development Studies where he pursued a Bachelor of Science in Applied Biology from 2005 to 2009 and served as a teaching assistant in the same University from 2009 to 2010.  In 2009, he won a grant of US$7,000.00 from a scientific breakthrough at UDS for developing a natural control for major insect pests.  He continued to the University of Ghana and pursued a Master of Philosophy in Entomology at the prestigious African regional Postgraduate Programme in Insect Science (ARPPIS) from 2010 to 2012.  \\u202fPrior to his graduation, he worked as a consultant at Vestergaard Frandsen (Noguchi Memorial Institute for Medical Research), Legon, from 2012 to 2013. At Vestergaard, he established the largest insectary in Ghana from scratch; developed rearing protocols for major storage pests and conducted bioassays for the popular deltamethrin-impregnated ZeroFly grain storage bag. In 2013, Dr Anankware resigned to pursue his PhD in Entomology at the Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology and the University of Nairobi where he was in charge of the Deputy Country Director of Fish for Africa (an NGO specialised in rearing insects for protein in feed).  He helped raise about €3 million from the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation and the Swiss National Science Foundation but resigned in August 2014 and joined Aspire Food Group (An NGO rearing edible insects for human consumption) as the Ghana Country Director.\\u202f Dr Anankware helped build Aspire Food Group from scratch with a US$ 1 million grant from the Bill Clinton Global Initiative and the Hult Prize but resigned in September 2016 to concentrate and finish his PhD in November 2016 and became the first and only entomologist in Africa.  Dr Anankware was a postdoctoral scholar at the University of Michigan, USA, a 2017 Mandela Washington Fellow at Purdue University, USA and a 2018 Humboldt Scholar at Humboldt University in Germany.

He also rears larvae of the black soldier fly (Hermetia illusions) as a cheap source of protein to replace fish meal and soybean meal in fish and poultry feed.  His dream is to see a food-secure, Africa.\\u202f Dr Anankware has served and contributed immensely to the NDC and had been a TEIN Patron at the University of Energy and Natural Resources (UENR) since 2018. He had also served as the Upper East Regional NDC Election monitoring member for the 2020 election. He was a campaign team member for the Navrongo Central Constituency in the 2020 election among other responsibilities in the party. In an interview with the GNA, he said the current harsh economic conditions of the country called for the need to get someone who can relate well with the people to win more votes for the NDC to defeat NPP in 2024. He said the people of Navrongo only need respect and someone who is down to earth and not someone who will lord his position on them. “This is the second time I’m contesting, and I know the delegates will give me their blessings during the primary to represent them since the current MP has lost touch with the constituents and his re-election spells doom for the party in 2024”, he said.',\n",
       " 'A few days after the nomination form was picked for former President John Mahama to lead the largest opposition party, the National Democratic Congress (NDC), into the 2024 presidential election, a staunch member of the party, Ambassador Kwesi Ahwoi has suggested that Prof. Jane Naana Opoku-Agyemang deserves to be retained as running mate.In an exclusive interview with Starr News Eastern Regional Correspondent, Kojo Ansah at the sidelines of an event at Koforidua Technical University on Friday, Kwesi Ahwoi said even though former President Mahama has the prerogative right to appoint any running mate of choice, nothing stops him from re-appointing his 2020 running mate to partner him again into 2024.“I have made a lot of statements. I have made a statement that I will do everything to make sure President John Mahama comes back to be President of this country and of course, he has to decide who will be his running mate. I don’t see anything wrong at all and nothing that stops Prof. Jane Naana Opoku Agyemang from being the running mate”. Ambassador Kwesi Ahwoi stated.The former Interior Minister and current Chairman of Former Ambassadors and High Commissioners under the NDC, dismissed old-age arguments against Prof.Jaane Naana Opoku Agyemang. He said Prof.Jane Naana Opoku Agyemang, can rise to become the next President after John Mahama.“People are talking about age and all. Age is not a concern. Age is being made a concern because we have a leadership today that is making age look like we have lost track. But if I tell you my age standing here you will be amazed but I have not lost track. So Naana whether she is 78, 79, or 80 can still be President of this country when President John Mahama finishes his service, that should not be a worry at all. Senior Kwabena Duffuor is putting in his cap. Kwabena Duffuor should be getting close to 79, what does he get to do with that, he got his brains, he got everything that he can use to lead this country.so I don’t see anything wrong with that(old age), Is it because Naana is a woman?” he quizzed.Ambassador Kwesi Ahwoi said it is about time women are given opportunity to rule the country given the fact that men have been tried enough.“It is about time we put a woman in charge of this country . They have a lot to offer this country. We have tried men, we’ve seen where men have taken us. Let’s try the women”.Answering a question about whether or not Prof. Jaane Naana Opoku-Agyemang, will attract more votes for the NDC when made running mate to seal the party’s victory, Kwasi Ahwoi said Central region is an amorphous region therefore the seemingly poor performance of the party in 2020 should not be a litmus test for her re-appointment as running mate.“It is the party that brings numbers it is not really the individual….if the party is strong the candidate is only a reflection of the party. But specifically, she also has her constituency, she can pull resources, and she can pull people. Most people are not calculating things well they think we lost in the central region. We lost the presidential election in Centralia Region because people forget that the central region is an amorphous region. It is not only Fantes. Central region is a combination of Ashantes, Akyems, Denkyiras just name it so don’t look at Fante and say because Naana is a Fante he should bring Central region, no! We have to go beyond that”.Prof Jane Naana Opoku-Agyemang, an academician, the first female Vice-Chancellor of the University of Cape Coast, and a former Education Minister was the running mate for the 2020 Presidential candidate of NDC John Dramani Mahama.However, lost the election to incumbent President Nana Akufo-Addo of the ruling New Patriotic Party who polled 6,730,587 represented 51.30% as against 6,213,182 vote representing 47.36% polled by John Dramani Mahama of the NDC.',\n",
       " 'Senior Research Fellow at Kumasi Technical University, Dr. Smart Sarpong, has averred that contenders of John Dramani Mahama in the National Democratic Congress (NDC) presidential race would need to put in more effort to beat him.According to him, whoever emerges as the winner would have to go the extra mile to oust the governing New Patriotic Party (NPP) from office in the 2024 general elections.Speaking on Oyerepa FM on February 23, 2023, he said, \"If you are going for a battle and you don’t note the quantum of work you have to do, you start from the failing point. If we want to put President Mahama aside, the work we will have to put into it is 10 times more than he would have done before we can unseat the NPP.\"\"If someone wants to be the flagbearer, what Mahama would have done using 3 or 5 tactics, the rest of them, Kojo Bonsu, Ernest and Duffour, they have to accept that they have to work 10 times harder than John Mahama would have in order to take the flagbearership,\" he added.The National Democratic Congress (NDC) officially closed nominations for the flagbearer position on Friday, February 24, 2023.At the close of nominations, four aspirants which include former President John Dramani Mahama, picked forms to contest in the race.The other three contestants were Dr. Kwabena Duffour, Kojo Bonsu, and Ernest Kwaku Kobeah.Meanwhile, the presidential and parliamentary primaries have been slated for Saturday, May 13, 2023.ESA/WA',\n",
       " \"In approximately a year and 9 months, Ghanaians will go to the polls to make another big decision about who will lead the country’s affairs at the helm of the presidency for 4 years.While Ghana has quite a number of political parties, the 2 biggest parties – the incumbent New Patriotic Party (NPP) and the National Democratic Congress (NDC) are at the forefront of all of these.Both parties are lacing their shoes to face each other on the day but ahead of that, there will be party primaries to elect a flagbearer who will represent the party and a running mate to assist.In a few months, specifically, on May 13, 2023, the biggest opposition party in Ghana – the NDC will elect its presidential and parliamentary aspirants for the party, and as such, possible candidates hoping to occupy the various positions have started indicating their intentions.On Wednesday, February 22, 2023, three candidates – former president and 3-time flagbearer of the NDC, John Dramani Mahama; Former Kumasi Mayor, Kojo Bonsu and Businessman, Ernest Kwaku Kobeah all picked up their nomination forms to indicate their interest in vying for the flagbearership position of the party.On Thursday, February 23, 2022, former Bank of Ghana Governor, Dr. Kwabena Duffour also picked up his nomination forms for the same position.If given the nod, the elected candidate will face another from the NPP and other political parties to contest for the presidency in the country.In this piece, we present a brief profile of all four candidates who have so far picked up forms in the NDC to contest:John Dramani Mahama:John Dramani Mahama was born on the 29th of November 1958 in Damongo in the Northern Region.

       " 'A member of the National Democratic Congress (NDC), Kwasi Ofori Agyemang also known as Zuba has stated that John Dramani Mahama loses nothing if he is not given the opportunity to lead the NDC in the election 2024.He believes John Dramani Mahama has accomplished a lot in his career and the NDC will suffer greatly if the party does not win the next general elections on the wings of the former president’s popularity and credentials.Speaking on EIB Networks English platform in Kumasi monitored by MyNewsGh.com, Zuba noted the establishment within the party will make everything possible to get Mahama elected in its upcoming presidential primaries.“Within the Ghanaian society when the establishment wants to go left, and you decide to go right you might not see yourself well. The (NDC) establishment is for Mahama,” Zuba said.“The people who call the shots in NDC are all on Mahama’s side. NDC needs John Mahama more than he needs us, the NDC needs John Mahama more than he needs the party. If John Mahama is not on the ticket, he loses nothing, all the treatment that will be given to a president and I mean any president that comes same conditions of services goes to him”, he revealedHe is therefore urging the NDC not to make a mistake by not giving Mahama the opportunity to lead the party.“We should not make a mistake by allowing just anybody to lead this great party to victory in 2024. It is Mahama or no other person,” he warned.',\n",
       " \"The chairperson of the Convention Peoples Party (CPP) Nana Akosua Frimpomaa Sarpong Kumankumah, has called on Ghanaians to consider CPP in the upcoming 2024 general elections. She said that the party is better positioned to address Ghana's issues utilizing Dr Osagyefo Kwame Nkrumah's 1960 seven-year development strategy, which she believes is still relevant today. Speaking at the news conference held in Accra, on Friday 24, 2023 to commemorate the 57th anniversary of the overthrow of Dr Kwame Nkrumah and the CPP government, she argued that neither the governing New Patriotic Party (NPP) nor the National Democratic Congress (NDC) has anything to offer Ghanaians and for that matter, they need to be voted out in the upcoming elections.“The duopoly cannot solve the problems. It is no magic, it is a formula, and as I said, success is duplicable. It is cut and paste. Once it’s working, cut and paste it…political independence without economic independence is meaningless, and that is what we are experiencing today,” she said. Nana Akosua Kumankumah added that the NPP and opposition NDC had shown over the years that, they did not have what was needed to deliver the development Ghanaians desired. “The leadership is not supposed to be blamed. It is we, the Ghanaians, that need to be blamed because if they would have done it, they would have done it by now,” the chairperson added.Watch the latest edition of BizTech and Biz Headlines below:Watch the latest edition of Business Moments below:AM/SARA\",\n",
       " 'Alan Kyerematen, New Patriotic Party (NPP) flagbearer hopeful, has indicated that he stands a better chance of breaking the eight-year mantra for his party.  According to Alan Kyerematen, with the current economic challenges in the country, what the NPP needed was a candidate who is appealing to the masses to enable the party to break the 8-year power chain. “I think the most difficult challenge that confronts us as a party going into the general election is finding a leader who goes beyond the NPP in terms of his or her own record. We need a candidate whom you can market to the people of Ghana but not just the NPP,” he said. The flag bearer hopeful said this during a visit to the Upper East Region when he met with party executives, the clergy, traders, drivers, and supporters of the NPP.  Alan Kyerematen stated that winning an election in Ghana goes beyond political party and added that the individual leading the party must be appealing to the masses, “I think I fit the bill not just because I have been in this game for some time, but my appeal cut across political parties, religion and ethnic divide.”  The former Trade and Industry Minister who also spoke on URA Radio in Bolgatanga as part of his campaign tour to the region said his vision about transforming Ghana that started about 22 years ago could have fetched the country not less than 50 billion dollars (about $150 per person in the US) every year if the vision had been continued. “So, you can imagine the transformation that would have occurred from that time up to now. As a country, it is time for you to have a new leader that understands business and understands how to move the private sector and support the productive sectors of our economy,” he added. Under his leadership as Trade and Industry Minister, Alan Kyerematen said with support from the private sector, over 296 factories were established in different districts across the country in the past three and half years of the establishment of the government’s flagship policy ‘one district, and factory’. “Two years ago, when I started talking about producing and assembling cars here in Ghana, people were not so sure. But to the glory of God, now we have all the major global auto companies assembling cars here in Ghana. Volkswagen, VW, Toyota, Nissan, Kia, Hyundai, and very soon, Isuzu, Honda. All these things could not happen by chance but the result of a big vision and that is what you need as a leader,” he stated',\n",

May God continue to bless Western Region.” Speaking to Ghana News Agency in Takoradi, the former Attorney-General and Minister of Justice nourished the hope that his campaign message was going down well with the people and was confident to win the Presidential bid to lead the NPP in the 2024 Presidential elections.

The external creditors provided Ghana with a certain criterion the country must meet to secure a possible $3 billion bailout.The government introduced the Domestic Debt Exchange Program (DDEP) to restructure debt as part of the steps to reach board-level approval with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) on a $3 billion facility to restore macroeconomic stability in the country.The government targeted 80% participation in the program to help restructure 137.3 billion Ghana cedis in bonds on the domestic market to bring its total debt, which stands at about 575.5 billion Ghana cedis to sustainable levels.Speaking on Morning Starr the Political Scientist said that the government’s mismanagement of corruption is the reason we need to accept all these conditionalities from IMF for a possible bailout.“We are so excited that IMF is going to give us close to 3 billion for starters and all that. But if we manage corruption very well, I’m afraid we will not need that money with its attendant problems and conditions. Let’s look at the issue of waste and a lot of information are available within the auditor general’s report year by year. How far have we come, and how far have we learned from them to continue to see these things in our books? It is unfortunate.“If you look at issue of waste, in terms of projects we pursue. Projects that have little or no benefit for society and then we are in there. We undertake projects without records of stakeholder engagement, and when people raise their voices those projects become abandoned and we adjust to devising such projects. We have seen issues of misapplication of state resources. In the sense that the constitution makes it mandatory for all government that when you inherit power, any project that is done using state money you will continue,” Dr. Asante explained.He continued; “But there are buildings today that are languishing in the bush and that we don’t seem to care about it. we forget that state money was put into such resources. Look at the way we execute contracts in this country as if there is no supervisor of contracts that the state has awarded. We do it anyhow and people benefit from that through poor supervision and poor execution of state projects. What is more, is that we see even some is that we see of these contracts ending up in judgement debt.”',\n",

Edem Agbana, who hopes to take over the position from the incumbent, James Klutse Avedzi, who has announced his decision to no longer contest, added that he wants to use this opportunity to secure a future of education and employment for the youth of Ketu North. “My most fundamental aim for this bid however is to see that years down the line Ketu North has a critical mass of citizens who are well resourced in terms of education, skills, employment and income. “This together with socio-economic infrastructure upgrade shall be the cornerstone of our new development paradigm in Ketu North,” he stressed. Should his bid go through and he is elected MP for the constituency on December 7, 2024, Edem Agbana will become one of the youngest to represent the party, and the country in Ghana, in parliament.

Now, he has relocated from the constituency and leaves in East Legon. Anytime we call him the excuse he gives us is that he has been occupied by parliamentary duties, meanwhile we voted for you to go to the Parliament you have been so busy with it duties,\" an old woman who is a delegate told this portal.Prince Zakaria is an indigene of Madina. He is a grandchild of Alhaji Haruna Yussif (Antinana) one of the cohorts of the founder of Madina.He coordinated the transportation of delegates to the just-ended national youth conference in Cape Coast.With the NDC parliamentary primaries just around the corner, one of the places that will be of particular interest is the Madina constituency, where Zakaria, who is considered an underdog but has the support of the delegates and grassroots, is likely to unseat lawyer Sosu.',\n",

He added “There was a candidate who was running mate in 2008 (John Mahama). He became a flagbearer in 2012, which is called progress. “In 2016, he lost which is also called a product decline, and in 2020 he lost again which is another product decline.

       " \"Presidential hopeful of the New Patriotic Party (NPP), Alan Kyerematen, has described the economic policies pursued over the years by several governments as a 'cul de sac.'Speaking on URA Radio in Bolgatanga in the Upper East leg of his nationwide tour, Alan Kyerematen pointed out that the narrow focus of Ghana's continued reliance on cocoa, gold, and a few primary raw material exports, is a cul de sac orientation to economic management, and which has limited growth in the economy. Doing things the same way over and over returns the same results. Cocoa, for example, has brought in under $2billion per annum into the Ghanaian economy annually over the past decades. However, the President's Special Intitiatives (PSIs), initiated by Alan Kyerematen, comprising four simple local products: salt, oil palm, cassava and garments, could have unleashed a potential combined annual income stream of $60b a year. However, policy distortion and irregular political choices reduced the nations' capacity to grow and benefit from the PSI's. Currently, the ten point strategic growth pillars developed and being implemented under Hon. Kyerematen, during his tenure as Minister for Trade and Industry, has brought in 1D1F, the automotive industry, and others. Speaking to the Great Transformational Plan  (GTP), Alan inspires that the country deserves leadership with a big vision. A vision that moves us beyond the cul de sac into strategic growth areas following through on the GTP. Alan Kyerematen is also primary to the design, establishment and implementation of the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA), which brings together a market of nearly a billion and a half consumers for producers within the diversified economy necessary to expand opportunities for the youth. On the same programme, Mr Alan Kyerematen reiterated his desire to modernise the New Patriotic Party (NPP) into a formidable force to better drive public policy and thence enable better mobilisation of communities towards opportunities. Not only will he create a businesslike Party, capable of generating independent financial, technical and human resources but also a big voice into Government appointments, especially at local level.

Because all the ministries cannot bring their programmes to cabinet meetings so these committees collect all the programmes of ministries under them and present them during the meetings.“But when it comes to the management of the economy, it is the Economic Management Team that has been responsible for it since and nobody should run away from it,”  he said Twi.He questioned why the chairperson of the Economic Committee does not address Ghanaians on the economy if s/he is indeed superior to the head of the Economic Management Team, who is required to do so.Watch the interview below:Meanwhile, catch the latest GhanaWeb TV Election Desk interview with Francis Addai-Nimoh, as he discusses his plans to become the NPP's flagbearer, below:You can also watch this episode of People & Places on GhanaWeb TV below:IB/OGB\",\n",

They are looking for someone who will relate well with them and not have the boss, subordinate relationship.You can be from there but you are not humble enough to have time for the party members. They see Bawumia and he is like a son to the Ashantis. He endears so much to the party and they know him very well. He comes for funerals and joins most social gatherings in the region. During campaigns, he’s the one they see. You can say you are from the Ashanti Region but have the people seen you campaigning for the party in the region before?\"If you want a position in the NPP and you tell the people from Ashanti Region that they have to vote for you, what the NPP members in the Ashanti Region will ask you is when was the last time you came to Bosome Freho or Ejura to campaign. They can say that Bawumia who you claim is not from Ashanti Region 2020, 2016 campaign we were with him in the Ashanti Region.The Ashanti party is closer to Bawumia than anything. This is right from the grassroots. When we come to the Ashanti Region, you’ll get lots of the chairmen, and constituency chairmen following Vice President.Out of the number of MPs in the Ashanti Region, if any candidate apart from Bawumia is able to get more than five MPs supporting them, I will say they will win the election. Bawumia will have the support. Bawumia will get not less than 80% of the Ashanti MPs supporting him. When some persons who said they are from the Ashanti Region went back home, they had only two MPs behind them. But when Bawumia is in the Ashanti Region, he has full support from the grassroots upwards. This is an indication of who the people want.

       " ' Lawyer Wahid Bampuori-Iddrisu has picked parliamentary candidate nominee forms to contest the primaries on the ticket of the National Democratic Congress on May 13, 2023. The Accra-based senior party member and legal practitioner has consistently contested the seat in Wa Central. This is his third attempt he’s seeking to annex the seat from the incumbent Rashid Pelpuo. The information available to GhanaWeb indicates that Mr. Bampuori-Iddrrisu (Esq) is the preferred candidate for most party stakeholders and stalwarts in the constituency. According to a constituency executive, among other things, “Wahid’s consistency and commitment to party activities though he lost the primaries on two occasions is giving him some sympathy and sense of acceptance”. The source added that Wahid has a very good message that is being delivered on a clean and honest campaign. The 56-year-old legal luminary was also described as genuinely generous, friendly, and well-networked enough to lead the party in parliament. \"He was the first and only member of the NDC that has constructed and donated two party offices  which he built from his own resources to the constituency,\" the source added. The constituency seems to be drifting away from the 18 years of leadership of the incumbent and 12 years of neglect of the constituency by Hudu Mogtari to the generous lawyer and founding member of the party. The Wa Central seat will be keenly contested but critics observe that Lawyer Wahid’s team is too slow and seems drowned in the cross-fire between Rashid Pelpuo and Hudu Mogtari\\'s teams.

       " \"The Deputy Spokesperson for Alan Kyerematen, Richard Nyamah, has claimed that it is because a powerful person within the New Patriotic Party (NPP) heavily invested in the campaign of the sitting Member of Parliament for Adenta, Mohammed Adamu Ramadan, that he won the seat. It is worth noting that the current MP is a member of the opposition National Democratic Congress (NDC), but is also the sister of the wife of the vice president, Samira Bawumia. According to Richard Nyamah, the only reason Yaw Buaben Asamoa, a one-time MP for the Adentan constituency was unable to retain that seat is because of the contributions of this powerful person, who he described as Annoh-Dompreh's preferred choice.  He said this while reacting to an earlier interview of the Majority Chief Whip in Parliament, Frank Annoh-Dompreh, on Adom TV, where the legislator dared Buaben Asamoa to win back the Adenta seat which has, for many years, been a New Patriotic Party (NPP) seat. “The Hon MP further went ahead to malign Hon Yaw Buaben Asamoa, former MP for Adentan and former Director of NPP Party Communications, now Spokesperson and Director of Communications for the Alan Kyerematen Campaign, by casting untrue aspersions on his person and character and then cheekily damning him to dare to win back the Adentan Parliamentary Seat, lost to the Party in the 2020 General elections. The real question is why and how the seat was lost. “If the Hon Annoh-Dompreh is not familiar with the story of how his preferred candidate for leadership of the NPP reportedly helped invest heavily in his brother-in-law to gift an NPP held seat to our main opponents, then he is indeed doing the High Office of Chief Whip an injustice. “It is the business of the Chief Whip to have his finger on the pulse of the Party but his aspersions in respect of Adentan Constituency show that either he is not on top of his game or that he has deliberately blinded himself to further the interests of his preferred candidate, even if the parliamentary preferences of his candidate have been hurtful to the fortunes of the NPP.  Now the question that begs answering is, will Annoh-Dompreh be singing praises to his preferred candidate if he was destooled by his brother-in-law from the NDC with the tacit support of the Vice President of the land?” he wrote. Richard Nyamah also refuted claims by the MP that Alan Kyerematen was in charge of an Economic Management Committee. He indicated that there is no such committee and that if there is, then Frank Annoh-Dompreh should produce its members, as well as its mandate.

       " 'Director of Communications for the governing New Patriotic Party (NPP), Richard Ahiagbah has stated that the Akufo-Addo government is on course to restore the country’s economic stability and growth that existed before the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic.Addressing the press at the party headquarters in Aslym Down, Accra, today Wednesday 22 February 2023, Richard Ahiagbah, said the government’s Post Covid-19 Program for Economic Growth (PC-PEG) is a solid blueprint that is ushering the country out of the economic setback the people of Ghana have had to endure the last 12months.NDC’s poor recordBefore he outlined the recovery plans of the Akufo-Addo administration, Mr. Ahiagbah, took a swipe at the opposition National Democratic Congress (NDC) for what he says is a deliberate effort on the part of the opposition party to “misled many Ghanaians to think that [the Akufo-Addo government] has mismanaged the economy since assuming office”.“This claim by the NDC however is not supported by the hard economic data and the reality around the world. In all these, the NDC has not provided any credible alternative solution(s). They are talking a lot but not about solutions.  It is blame, mischaracterization, and denial of obvious global economic realities” Richard Ahiagbah said. Supporting his argument on the “poor performance” of the NDC when they were in office between 2013 and 2016, Ahiagbah said, “on the larger economy which is measured in terms of GDP the NDC, supervised a perpetual decline from 2013 to 2016”.“In 2013, GDP was 7.3%; in 2014 it was 4%; in 2015 it was 3.9% and in 2016 it was 3.7%. In terms of percentage changes in the GPD, the economy deteriorated by 45.2% in 2014 compared to 2013 growth. Similarly, the economy decreased by 2.5% in 2015 and 5.12% in 2016.“In the Real Sector, which includes Agriculture, Industry, and Service, the NDC’s performance was even worst. From 2013, real sector growth plummeted significantly across all sectors. In 2014 all the sectors grew at a negative rate using 2013 performance as a base” Mr. Ahiagbah said.“Let me remind you that this poor performance was against the NDC inheriting an economy that had discovered oil in commercial quantities and began production in 2010; which shot Ghana’s GDP to 14% in 2011.  All that growth momentum was vanquished by the NDC, led by Ex-President Mahama” he added. NPP’s outstanding performanceComparing the NDC’s performance with the NPP’s time in office before the COVID-19 pandemic and the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the NPP’s director of communications noted that available data shows that the “NPP turned around the contracting economy it inherited from the NDC in 2017 to date”.“On GDP, 2017 GDP grew at 8.1 percent compared to 3.7 percent in 2016, 2018 GDP grew by 6.3%, 2019 GDP grew by 6.5% and 2020 GDP grew by 0.5%. In the real rector, the industry recorded its highest growth of 16.7% in 2017, with Agriculture at 8.4%, and the Services sectors at 4.3%.“Industry grew from a mournful negative 0.5% in 2016 to 16.7 percent in 2017 and Services grew from 2.8% in 2016 to an appreciable 4.3% in 2017,” Ahiagbah said.“The Agric sector also grew from a dismal 2.7% in 2016 to 8.4% in 2017. Friends from the media, this data we just reviewed imply that the vulnerable in our society, the poor, indeed, the vast majority of Ghanaians fared much better under NPP in 2017. Data is sacred” he added.Recovery planAs part of the recovery plan, Mr. Ahiagbah said “Government has introduced the Post Covid-19 Program for Economic Growth (PC-PEG) to among others establish a sustainable macro-fiscal path, restore debt sustainability and macro-economic stability underpinned by key structural reform and social protection”.According to Richard Ahiagbah, “the PC-PEG will address the economic challenges of this country through fiscal consolidation, get treatment, and structural reform” and that “Government through the Central Bank has responded with a raft of monetary policy measures, including the bi-weekly FX forward auction, and the BDC forex auction which has helped subdue the pressure on the spot FX market”.“To complement the monetary policies which have been activated, the Government has subsequently announced Expenditure-led measures including a 30% cut in discretionary expenditures, a moratorium on the new creation of government units, a freeze on government travels, 30 percent cut in salaries of the executive and political appointees, among others,” Ahiagbah said.“Other policies such as the implementation of the Gold for Oil (G4O) program, implementation of the COVID-19 Alleviation & Revitalization of Enterprises Support (CARES) Program, to inject some Ghc100 billion into the economy” [are all part of the larger strategy of the government to the country’s economic stability] Ahiagbah added.“Government’s transformative agenda to digitalize the economy [which is aimed at formalizing] the Ghanaian economy & improve its administrative systems & global competitiveness, the banking sector reforms which has introduced a tighter regulatory & supervisory framework in the sector are all part of the steps government is taking to revive the economy.“Through these innovative measures, the government is demonstrating its resolve to build back the economy quickly and restore fiscal rectitude. Government’s commitment to these measures is a clear assurance that we are on the right track and capable of causing a turnaround of the economy with the resolute support of all Ghanaians” Richard Ahiagbah further stated.Way Forward for EconomyIn his press statement, the NPP\\'s director of communications identified several thematic areas that the government is paying attention to tackle the prevailing economic challenges.Mr. Ahiagbah noted that in 2022, the government introduced a raft of fiscal and monetary measures to rein in expenditures and improve revenue mobilization, including a cut in discretionary spending, a cut in the salaries of the executives, a freeze on foreign travel, among others\".\"The 2023 budget indicates the government’s desire to continue fiscal consolidation efforts and reduce the fiscal deficit in line with the pending IMF Programme. The government expects to record one of the lowest deficits this year, much lower than the GH¢64.0 billion announced in the 2023 budget\" Ahiagbah said.\"Expenditure measures, the debt treatment program, and structural reforms, among others, are all measures that the Akufo-Addo administration has embarked on to ensure that the economy is stabilized and subsequently made to grow as was the case before the COVID-19 pandemic\" Ahiagbah added.',\n",

It is all mathematical, and we have defeated him twice. He is even afraid to plainly declare whether he is going to contest or not. We are ready for him.”According to Ahiagbah, the NPP\\'s major preoccupation now is to improve the economy and ease the cost of living crisis that citizens have been faced with for the past few months.“We are interested in how we can build our economy, and we want to know whether he has the solution because we saw him vanquish the gains that he got, and we saw him collapse our economy and banking sector. \"He doesn’t have what it takes to improve Ghana because if he had what it took to do that, he wouldn’t have vanquished our economic gains and taken us to the IMF,” he stressed.Mahama declares bid, picks nomination formsMahama\\'s formal intention to run for a third consecutive shot at the presidency was reported when a number of NDC MPs confirmed that he was going to contest.On February 22, forms were picked on his behalf by Prof. Alabi and regional chairmen amid fanfare.

       " 'The General Secretary of the Convention People’s Party (CPP), Nana Yaa Jantuah has hit hard at the NPP government for keeping Finance Minister, Ken Ofori-Atta, in office months after the country’s economy deteriorated.The former Public Affairs Director for the Public Utilities Regulatory Commission (PURC) who was speaking on Power FM’s Inside Politics programme wondered why the minister was still in office after Ghana borrowed so hugely in a debt distress level.“Ken Ofori-Atta abon [Ken Ofori-Atta is incompetent],” she said in Akan while explaining that the finance minister is highly incompetent and unintelligent for allowing the economy to slowly grind to a halt amid warnings from experts.“When I call them F9 (unintelligent) ministers people want to come after me but that is who they are: non-performing ministers,” she argued.Yaa Jantuah said times are hard that the working class and the ordinary people cannot afford a 3 square meal which was possible before the NPP took over power in 2017.The hardship, she explained, was as a result of the inflationary spiral fuelled by a steep depreciation of the cedi which was not managed for a long time.To her, President Akufo-Addo should have sacked Ofori-Atta long before the economy got crushed to a point that the country cannot pay for its domestic and external debts.Experts and rating agents have described Ghana’s economy as one that is in a huge debt crisis.Finding a way to handle the government’s debts internationally, Finance Minister Ofori-Atta recently disclosed that the government has initiated talks with China over Ghana’s debt following a successful Domestic Debt Exchange Programme (DDEP).He told Citi News that negotiations with China are important because China holds the majority of the external bonds, stressing that he was to lead a delegation to China to plead for debt cancellation.“The big elephant in the room is China, we will be visiting China by the end of the week to really discuss how they come into the envelope as quickly as possible. So we are looking at that support from them. China represents about a third of the $5.7 billion loan and so it is important that we engage them,” he said.Nana Yaa Jantuah believes Ghana should not have degraded to a level that a team that mocked the previous government for going for an IMF bailout will now be drowned in debt borne out of mismanagement.He partly blamed the nepotistic nature of President Akufo-Addo who is related to Ofori-Atta for the economic mess which she said had plunged the country into hunger.',\n",

       " 'Francis Addai-Nimoh has shot down claims that big names in politics give people an advantage over their peers in any political race. According to the flagbearer-hopeful of the ruling New Patriotic Party (NPP), although it appears some of the personalities who have also indicated their intentions to run for the vacant role in the party are ‘bigger’ than him, that is not what will win them the elections. He explained that it takes such attributes as character and endearment to be able to win the hearts of the delegates of the party. “Big names do not win elections. Elections are won by your character, by your good self – endearing yourself to the electorates, articulating your vision and they having the acceptability for you that you could be, and you are qualified to be their leader; not necessarily any name as such,” he explained. Speaking with GhanaWeb TV’s Etsey Atisu in an interview on Election Desk, Francis Addai-Nimoh recalled how, for instance, he out-performed many more experienced names in the party during the 2014 presidential primaries of the NPP. He said that because of the confidence the delegates have in him, he came out third in that race, even though he was regarded as the underdog in the race. “Similarly, in 2014, when the seven contestants, and I was one of them, I was seen to be the underdog; I was seen to be someone unknown in the political environment of our country. The other six contestants had all worked under J. A. Kufuor’s administration either as ministers of state, or deputy ministers of state, and Addai-Nimoh had not been in that position before. “But when we went through that process in 2014, I came in third, which was an enviable position that I secured for myself, and that shows the potential that the NPP delegates found in me and then encouraged me to make progress with this ambition,” he added. The former Member of Parliament for Mampong also shared some other reasons why he is vying for the flagbearer position of the NPP again. Watch more below:AE/OGB',\n",

Dr Butakor said he is an indigene and grassroots person who is well-known across the constituency adding that his experience coupled with humility, connectedness and resourcefulness will be able to attract floating voters and votes of the majority of disgruntled NPP supporters due to the abysmal performance of the NPP over the years.

Madam Hayibor said she had fulfilled all her financial obligations to the Party in the quest for her development of the Party at home.   She noted that politics was a tool for development, and it was time for the youth to be part of the development and must play active roles to support the adults.

She said she believed the economic empowerment of women, which could be secured through laws, can help solve the global economic crisis, especially in Ghana and the world at large. Madam Hayibor said her position as a Women Organiser of the Party in Scotland led to the adoption of party Branches in the Hohoe Constituency for support as well as played key roles in the 2020 general elections in Hohoe. “I believe one of the ways to stand up for the marginalised in societies is to join the discussion tables and represent the views of the minorities and be the voice for the voiceless in society.”',\n",

Then ask what the effect will be if the pensioners are exempted or added. “For me, it was just simple,” he said.However, Ing.

He is still receiving attacks for the party and government, and you think I should sidestep him? All the current attacks from the opposition parties are being directed at him just because he has decided to sacrifice himself for the party,” he wrote on Facebook.Kennedy Osei forcefully stated that there are positions being occupied and enjoyed by government appointees under President Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo that are the results of the sacrifices of Dr. Bawumia, whom he further described as the nemesis of the opposition National Democratic Congress.\"Many are today holding different portfolios and positions in this Government because of the work he did for the party then in opposition in 2016. He singlehandedly took the entire NDC government on, both in opposition and in government, so no wonder they are after his head and would prefer that he not be on the NPP’s ticket. He is the greatest nemesis of the biggest opposition party,” he added.This latest endorsement by the Akim Swedru MP adds up to the overwhelming number of NPP parliamentarians who have thrown their weight behind the Vice President ahead of the party’s presidential primaries.Though Dr. Mahamudu Bawumia has not officially declared his intentions to be president, Dr. Gideon Boako, a spokesperson for the Vice President, has stated that the official announcement will be made if the party opens nominations for the primaries.You can also watch this episode of People & Places here:',\n",

According to him, the work had started by the time they came.Kojo Bonsu has also said that the party can only win the 2024 general elections with him as the lead candidate and win the Ashanti Region.He said the NDC’s bane over the years has been the votes from the Ashanti Region and he is the best person to curb that.“If I become the flagbearer of the party, the NDC will secure a lot of votes in the Ashanti region. This means I will break the monopoly and split the votes NPP secures in the region. Even today, the market women at Central Market and Kejetia Market are all supporting my presidential bid. The women have said that if I become the leader of the party, they will all vote for me.”“Today they see the vision and plan to develop Kumasi that we had,” he said.Kumasi Youth Association (KUYA) in 2016 awarded Kojo Bonsu for standing out among all former Mayors of the Kumasi Metropolitan Assembly.According to the group, the innovation of the former mayor gave birth to the famous Rattray Park, Kejetia Market and renovated Prempeh Assembly Hall among other equally important monumental infrastructural projects in Kumasi.You can also watch this episode of People & Places here:\",\n",

We remember how Mahama snubbed NDC members and appointed strangers like Raymond Atuguba, Nayong Billy Joe Alhassan Azong and others when he became president.”He called on, “all the executives that Mahama has promised the positions to reject his indecent proposal out of hand to show him he John Mahama cannot deceive any NDC guru with the promise of position.”Meanwhile, Moshake has urged the party’s delegates to, “get with the wind of change and vote massively for Dr. Kwabena Duffuor to lead the party in 2024.”',\n",

The third session of the eighth Parliament resumed on February 7, 2023, after the house went on break for Christmas and new festivities. Following the resumption of the house, Adwoa Safo did not make any appearance in the chamber even though she was in the country. Adwoa Safo’s absence from parliament was one of the most discussed topics in the country in 2022. The discussion came on the back of her leaving the country after the 2022 budget was passed on November 26, 2021. However, on November 11 2022, Adwoa Safo officially resumed her parliamentary duties following her return from the United States of America. Speaker of Parliament, Alban Bagbin, on October 26, 2022, ruled that the report of the committee set up to look into her case and that of two other MPs who absented themselves for a number of sittings should be presented before the whole house for a debate. Alban Bagbin dismissed the objection of the Majority Leader, Osei Kyei-Mensah-Bonsu, to the admissibility of the committee report for the consideration of the house. “As I have noted in this ruling, the decision (sic) on not to admit a motion is the exclusive preserve of the Speaker.

       " 'The Campaign Team of Mr Alan Kyerematen, a flagbearer hopeful of the New Patriotic Party (NPP) has urged the Party to hold its presidential primaries early to offer the prospective leader adequate time to prepare for the 2024 general election. The Team has also appealed to the Party’s leadership to allow aspirants to campaign ahead of the date for the primaries to offer them enough time to engage with delegates. In an interview with the Ghana News Agency, Mr Yaw Buaben Asamoa, Spokesperson for Mr Kyerematen’s Campaign, said the Camp would prefer the presidential primaries to be held in either August or September this year. “We believe that the earlier the date, the better. If we are to succeed ourselves as an administration, then it is important that we have the next potential President early so that the President can influence public policy going forward,” he said. Mr Asamoa said if elected earlier, the flagbearer would have the opportunity to make input in the priorities and budgets of the Government in a manner that would positively affect the chances of the Party in the next general election. He said the Party’s delegates also needed enough time to meet with the aspirants and assess their capabilities, hence the need for the Party to allow the aspirants to campaign ahead of their nomination. “If the nomination process is delaying because the Party cannot fix the date for the election, then it is difficult for the candidate and the Party itself because that space could be filled with activity between delegates and potential candidates,” Mr Asamoa said. The NPP is yet to announce a date for its presidential and parliamentary primaries. The Party’s National Council met in Accra earlier this month to decide on the date for the primaries, but the meeting was reported to have ended inconclusively. The Party said it would engage broadly on the issue to arrive at a consensus. Per the NPP’s Constitution, the Party must elect its presidential candidate 11 months before the general election, when it is in power. Mr Kyerematen, who has been working towards becoming President since 207, resigned as Minister of Trade and Industry last month to pursue his presidential ambition. He officially announced his decision to contest the NPP flagbearership race in an address on January 10, 2023. In that address, Mr Kyerematen said the country required a new plan to build a self-reliant economy to avoid going back to the International Monetary Fund in future. He said if he succeeded in his quest to become President in the next general election, he would launch and lead the execution of the Great Transformational Plan of Ghana, which would span the period 2025 to 2030 to revamp key sectors of the economy. Mr Asamoa said Mr Kyerematen had so far toured the Ashanti, Bono East, Bono, Ahafo, Western North, Volta, and Eastern regions, where he met chiefs and delegates to officially inform them about his decision to contest the NPP flagbearership race. “Everywhere we have been, there is the feeling that Mr Kyerematen is the right man in the right place for the right job,” he said.',\n",

He advised all parliamentary primary hopefuls against a campaign of insults, attacks, and acrimony, which sometimes characterised political competitions and called for a change of the status quo. “It’s imperative that we avoid politics of insults and attacks on one another and rather focus on the messages we have as aspirants for the Branch Executives in the interest of peace and harmony going forward,” he advised. Mr Tanko said his tour of the constituency affirms his commitment of prosecuting an issue-based campaign devoid of character assassinations, and all other unhealthy discourses that may frustrate intended reconciliation activities after the elections in the Ketu North constituency. “The gate of my house remains open to all NDC faithful, who truly seek the progress of our beloved constituency,” Tanko added as he campaigns on a message of  “New Dawn” (NUBUKƐ).',\n",
       " 'The national chairman of the ruling New Patriotic Party(NPP), Stephen Ntim, has said that the party will have to perform exceptionally to win the upcoming 2024 election.According to him, the party is poised to make history by retaining power beyond the eight-year rule by a political party under the Fourth Republic.“We are seeking to do something no political party in the history of this country has been able to do. We are seeking to win a third consecutive general election. We are seeking to break the eight that has so far eluded the two major political parties in the fourth republic.“Obviously, to achieve this extraordinary and unprecedented feat, we need to do the extraordinary. We cannot do the same things we’ve been doing from 1992 and expect to achieve a different result, more so, when the result in question, is one that no political party in Ghana has been able to achieve. This consciousness is what I expect to drive our 2024 project. We must all be conscious of the enormity of the task ahead of us to be able to work our hearts out towards its realization,” Chairman Ntim said while addressing a Retreat by the Council of Elders of the Greater Accra Region branch of the party at Peduase in Aburi.He added that the target of the current national executives is to ensure victory for the NPP come 2024 and nothing will stop them from achieving this objective.“Consistent with our mandate, we, as national officers, following our election in July 2022, set for ourselves, a target of working assiduously to retain power in 2024 to justify the confidence that had been reposed in us by the party’s delegates. This particular commitment to delivering nothing but victory to the party come 2024, has, at all times, been our primary focus in everything we do.”',\n",
       " \"Ohemaa Borngreat, a member of the National Democratic Congress (NDC) communication team, has berated President Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo’s administration over its misuse of funds it mobilized to fight the COVID-19 pandemic.She claimed in an interview with TV XYZ that the administration completely misappropriated over 20 billion (cedis) which is equivalent to one million five hundred ninety thousand four hundred fifty-seven dollars monies raised to combat the Covid-19 outbreak and is now seeking just 3 billion dollars from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) by way of the financial bailout. which her claim is false. She made these remarks while reacting to the government’s decision to include certain individuals in its domestic debt exchange programme. “By God’s grace, Covid is not a blessing but it is a blessing in disguise because when Covid came Ghanaians had a lot of benefits from the Covid. “So, if you’re a prudent government, couldn't you have invested the Covid money and we wouldn’t have even been here chasing the IMF for just 3 billion. “Whereby you had over 21 billion from the Covid fund. What did you do with the money? The Ministry of Information paid over 1.51 billion old cedis to themselves as risk allowance. So, the government has no vision for us,” she said. Meanwhile, the Minister of Finance, Ken Ofori-Atta, has calmed the nerves of pensioner bondholders, insisting that the government will not shortchange their legitimate rights but will honour their coupon payments and maturing principals, like all government bondholders.He told Parliament that the government remained committed to the well-being and dignity of the senior citizens and pensioners.On the other hand, President Akufo-Addo has also stated that the government’s debt exchange programme (DEP) was fraught with several challenges after its announcement, but it has largely been accepted by the citizenry.He made this known when the German Federal Minister of Finance, Christian Lindner, paid him a visit at the Jubilee House. The government has also announced 85% subscription rate for the DDEP which faced stiff challenges from a range of bondholders.AM/SARA\",\n",
       " 'Former Member of Parliament (MP) for Kwadaso Constituency Mr Samiu Kwadwo Nuamah has expressed disappointment in the New Patriotic Party (NPP) for playing mafia tactics in his constituency to unseat him during the 2020 elections.According to Mr Kwadwo Nuamah, his removal from the seat in the constituency was orchestrated by some bigwigs of the New Patriotic Party (NPP) at its headquarters in Accra.“People felt I had no political background so they decided to remove me from the seat by hook or crook. He has no Godfather, that’s all. So they do all those evil and call it Mafia. And somebody speak out with joy to say we have played him mafia.” Mr Kwadwo Nuamah told Kwame Tanko on Angel FM Kumasi in an interview monitored by MyNewsGH.com.He further revealed that, the source of such power struggle in the party is mostly the fight between an MP and CEO of a government agency.“The issue of fight between CEO and MPs is very brutal, and it brings some kind of hatred to you. A typical example is myself. I was in the UK, sold my house, came down and did campaign. I had a 90% win in the constituency which is unprecedented, that after elections, every 9 people out of 10 will vote for you, it has never happened. The party should have even contacted me and learn how I was able to do that”, Mr Kwadwo Nuamah narrated.The former lawmaker indicated that in most cases, people who are engaged in such mafia style do not build proper relationship with the party people at the grassroots.In the 2016 Parliamentary election in Kwadaso Constituency in the Ashanti Region, Hon Samiu Kwadwo Nuamah polled 61,631 representing 90.0% while the NDC candidate Monica Bawuah had 6,263 representing 9.2% of the total votes cast.In 2004 NPP candidate had, 83.2 with NDC 13.6, 2008 NPP polled 82.7% NDC 15.3%, whiles in 2012 the NPP Had 83.6% and polling NDC 14.5%.Mr Kwadwo Nuamah was succeeded by incumbent MP for the constituency Dr. Kingsley Nyarko in 2020.',\n",
       " \"The main opposition National Democratic Congress is challenging the National Identification Authority (NIA) to publish the number of eligible voters on its database.According to the NDC, this will enable the party to know the total number of people eligible to vote in the December 7, 2024 general elections.The Electoral Commission (EC) has insisted that its decision to make the Ghanacard the sole document for the registration of voters for the 2024 elections remains unchanged.The National Identification Authority (NIA) says it had so far captured about 17 million Ghanaians into its system after the officials of the EC had met them and said a backlog of 400,000 Ghanaians was yet to receive their cards after registration.The NDC is of the view that as it stands the NIA’s claims that it has issued 17 million cards hence the Ghana card should be made the sole document for the acquisition of a voter’s Identity card is untenable.The former deputy Communications Officer for the Ashanti Regional NDC office, Kweku Asafu Adjei, threw this challenge to the NIA to publish the data of eligible voters in an interview on the Ghana Yensom morning show hosted by Odehyeeba Kofi Essuman on Accra 100.5 FM on Friday, February 17, 2023.He stressed that foreigners, as well as minors aged 15 were allowed to register for Ghanacards so it is just fair for the NIA to tell Ghanaians the number of foreigners as well as minors.He said the 17 million people who have had their cards issued to them are all not eligible voters as the NIA is making Ghanaians believe.''It is just right that we know the eligible voters captured in the NIA’s system before the Ghanacard can be made a sole document for the acquisition of the voter's Identity card.He was of the view that not many people have been captured by the NIA and that if the Ghanacard was made the sole document many will be disenfranchised.He revealed that as of now the district offices of the NIA are not operational so people are not getting the opportunity to register for the Ghanacard.He alleged something sinister on the part of the NIA and the EC.\",\n",
       " 'Hopeson Adorye, a member of the New Patriotic Party (NPP), and a member of the campaign team of Alan Kyerematen, says “team Alan” is not perturbed about the support for Bawumia by some 102 MPs.Hopeson Adorye made this statement after news came out that 102 MPs in Parliament have said they back Bawumia.In an interview on Atinka FM’s AM Drive, Hopeson Adorye, likened Bawumia’s endorsement to that of Alan Kyerematen in 2007.He argued that although all ministers, majority of MPs supported Alan Kyerematen over Akufo-Addo in the primaries, the latter won massively.“I am not surprised, but I know that with God all things are possible. This is not the first time something of this sort is happening, and so we are not perturbed one bit. \"In 2007, when we were preparing for the primaries with over 17 aspirants, all ministers, majority MPs, and MMDCEs all supported Alan Kyerematen. It was only former executives who were supporting Akufo-Addo. But who won? Akufo-Addo won.“Even last year, during the election of the national executives, everyone supported John Boadu, but he eventually lost. \"We are focused, and we are doing our campaign. “So far as it’s not all the 138 MPs that have endorsed him, we are not shaken,”  Hopeson Adorye added.']"

       "['The immediate past Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of the Ghana Cylinder Manufacturing Company Limited (GCMCL), Madam Frances Ewurabena Asiam, has said that the Minister for Energy, Dr. Matthew Opoku Prempeh (NAPO), is not fit to partner Vice President Dr Mahamudu Bawumia as running mate should the latter be elected flagbearer of the New Patriotic Party (NPP). In an interview on UTV News, Frances Asiam insisted that Dr. Opoku Prempeh is unfit to be a running mate especially on the ticket of the NPP.“NAPO cannot be a running mate, these are all the issues that will be coming up during my press conference, so let’s hold on for now” she told the news anchor. Frances Asiam further revealed that she resigned from her post because of the actions of the Minister for Energy, Dr Matthew Opoku Prempeh. We can confirm that Frances Ewurabena Asiam and Dr. Opoku Prempeh have been at loggerheads over an agreement for between the GCMCL and the Ghana Gas Company for the construction of a new gas processing plant. It is also clear that Dr Opoku Prempeh wanted Genser Energy to establish a new gas processing plant instead of the state-owned Ghana National Gas Processing Company. Madam Asiam narrated how she worked hard to put the GCMCL on a growth trajectory and how NAPO and his cabals want to take over the company from her.She explained that the unwarranted interference from the Energy Minister is what led her to resign from the company before the President Akufo-Addo appointed Madam Genevieve Sackey as the new Chief Executive Officer of the company.“We decided to expand the company and because we do not have the means for the expansion, another state-owned company agreed to help us with it. The company was going to take over the acquisition so that our workforce will be saved and we have already acquired the land for the expansion. \"The minister does not want the state agency to acquire the company, he wants another state agency to. And I also don’t agree so I have to resigned so NAPO will take the company” she stated angrily. Some political watchers believe the fight between the two top NPP members is far from over as Frances Asiam has threatened to reveal all the diabolical agendas orchestrated by NAPO against other potential running mates that the Vice President is allegedly considering should he become the flagbearer of the elephant party.',\n",
       " 'Senior Research Fellow at Kumasi Technical University, Dr. Smart Sarpong, has averred that contenders of John Dramani Mahama in the National Democratic Congress (NDC) presidential race would need to put in more effort to beat him.According to him, whoever emerges as the winner would have to go the extra mile to oust the governing New Patriotic Party (NPP) from office in the 2024 general elections.Speaking on Oyerepa FM on February 23, 2023, he said, \"If you are going for a battle and you don’t note the quantum of work you have to do, you start from the failing point. If we want to put President Mahama aside, the work we will have to put into it is 10 times more than he would have done before we can unseat the NPP.\"\"If someone wants to be the flagbearer, what Mahama would have done using 3 or 5 tactics, the rest of them, Kojo Bonsu, Ernest and Duffour, they have to accept that they have to work 10 times harder than John Mahama would have in order to take the flagbearership,\" he added.The National Democratic Congress (NDC) officially closed nominations for the flagbearer position on Friday, February 24, 2023.At the close of nominations, four aspirants which include former President John Dramani Mahama, picked forms to contest in the race.The other three contestants were Dr. Kwabena Duffour, Kojo Bonsu, and Ernest Kwaku Kobeah.Meanwhile, the presidential and parliamentary primaries have been slated for Saturday, May 13, 2023.ESA/WA',\n",
       " \"In approximately a year and 9 months, Ghanaians will go to the polls to make another big decision about who will lead the country’s affairs at the helm of the presidency for 4 years.While Ghana has quite a number of political parties, the 2 biggest parties – the incumbent New Patriotic Party (NPP) and the National Democratic Congress (NDC) are at the forefront of all of these.Both parties are lacing their shoes to face each other on the day but ahead of that, there will be party primaries to elect a flagbearer who will represent the party and a running mate to assist.In a few months, specifically, on May 13, 2023, the biggest opposition party in Ghana – the NDC will elect its presidential and parliamentary aspirants for the party, and as such, possible candidates hoping to occupy the various positions have started indicating their intentions.On Wednesday, February 22, 2023, three candidates – former president and 3-time flagbearer of the NDC, John Dramani Mahama; Former Kumasi Mayor, Kojo Bonsu and Businessman, Ernest Kwaku Kobeah all picked up their nomination forms to indicate their interest in vying for the flagbearership position of the party.On Thursday, February 23, 2022, former Bank of Ghana Governor, Dr. Kwabena Duffour also picked up his nomination forms for the same position.If given the nod, the elected candidate will face another from the NPP and other political parties to contest for the presidency in the country.In this piece, we present a brief profile of all four candidates who have so far picked up forms in the NDC to contest:John Dramani Mahama:John Dramani Mahama was born on the 29th of November 1958 in Damongo in the Northern Region. He received his basic education at Achimota Basic School and later moved to the Ghana Secondary School in Tamale.He had his university education at the University of Ghana, in Legon, receiving a Bachelor of Arts degree in history in 1981. After this, he moved back to Tamale, where he taught history at Ghana Secondary School.He also did his post-graduate programme in Communication Studies at the University of Ghana and graduated in 1986. He then proceeded to the Institute of Social Sciences in Moscow to receive a post-graduate degree in Social Psychology in 1988. He entered politics in 1996 as an MP for Bole Bamboi and was re-elected in 2000 and 2004.As MP, he was appointed a Deputy Minister for Communications in 1997 and became the Minister for Communications from 1998 until 2001.He also was nominated as running mate to Prof. John Evans Atta Mills in 2008 and became Vice President in 2009.In July 2012, he succeeded the late John Evans Atta Mills and was elected as President of Ghana in 2012.He has since contested as Flagbearer for the party in the 2016 and 2020 elections respectively.He is contesting again in 2024 to lead the NDC as flagbearer.Dr. Kwabena Duffour:Dr. Kwabena Duffour was born in the Ashanti Region of Ghana. He had his secondary education at Prempeh College on a Ghana Cocoa Board Scholarship and then proceeded to the University of Ghana, Legon where he graduated in 1968 with a Bachelor’s degree in Economics, majoring in Statistics and Operations Research.Dr. Kwabena Duffuor started his working career in July 1968 at the Volta River Authority.  He then moved on to Ghana Commercial Bank (GCB) now GCB Bank in February 1969. Dr. Duffour obtained a USAID and African Graduate Fellowship Awards to pursue further studies at the Syracuse University in New York while working at GCB.

The (NDC) establishment is for Mahama,” Zuba said.“The people who call the shots in NDC are all on Mahama’s side. NDC needs John Mahama more than he needs us, the NDC needs John Mahama more than he needs the party. If John Mahama is not on the ticket, he loses nothing, all the treatment that will be given to a president and I mean any president that comes same conditions of services goes to him”, he revealedHe is therefore urging the NDC not to make a mistake by not giving Mahama the opportunity to lead the party.“We should not make a mistake by allowing just anybody to lead this great party to victory in 2024.

She said that the party is better positioned to address Ghana's issues utilizing Dr Osagyefo Kwame Nkrumah's 1960 seven-year development strategy, which she believes is still relevant today. Speaking at the news conference held in Accra, on Friday 24, 2023 to commemorate the 57th anniversary of the overthrow of Dr Kwame Nkrumah and the CPP government, she argued that neither the governing New Patriotic Party (NPP) nor the National Democratic Congress (NDC) has anything to offer Ghanaians and for that matter, they need to be voted out in the upcoming elections.“The duopoly cannot solve the problems. It is no magic, it is a formula, and as I said, success is duplicable. It is cut and paste. Once it’s working, cut and paste it…political independence without economic independence is meaningless, and that is what we are experiencing today,” she said. Nana Akosua Kumankumah added that the NPP and opposition NDC had shown over the years that, they did not have what was needed to deliver the development Ghanaians desired. “The leadership is not supposed to be blamed. It is we, the Ghanaians, that need to be blamed because if they would have done it, they would have done it by now,” the chairperson added.Watch the latest edition of BizTech and Biz Headlines below:Watch the latest edition of Business Moments below:AM/SARA\",\n",
       " 'Alan Kyerematen, New Patriotic Party (NPP) flagbearer hopeful, has indicated that he stands a better chance of breaking the eight-year mantra for his party.  According to Alan Kyerematen, with the current economic challenges in the country, what the NPP needed was a candidate who is appealing to the masses to enable the party to break the 8-year power chain. “I think the most difficult challenge that confronts us as a party going into the general election is finding a leader who goes beyond the NPP in terms of his or her own record. We need a candidate whom you can market to the people of Ghana but not just the NPP,” he said. The flag bearer hopeful said this during a visit to the Upper East Region when he met with party executives, the clergy, traders, drivers, and supporters of the NPP.  Alan Kyerematen stated that winning an election in Ghana goes beyond political party and added that the individual leading the party must be appealing to the masses, “I think I fit the bill not just because I have been in this game for some time, but my appeal cut across political parties, religion and ethnic divide.”  The former Trade and Industry Minister who also spoke on URA Radio in Bolgatanga as part of his campaign tour to the region said his vision about transforming Ghana that started about 22 years ago could have fetched the country not less than 50 billion dollars (about $150 per person in the US) every year if the vision had been continued. “So, you can imagine the transformation that would have occurred from that time up to now. As a country, it is time for you to have a new leader that understands business and understands how to move the private sector and support the productive sectors of our economy,” he added. Under his leadership as Trade and Industry Minister, Alan Kyerematen said with support from the private sector, over 296 factories were established in different districts across the country in the past three and half years of the establishment of the government’s flagship policy ‘one district, and factory’. “Two years ago, when I started talking about producing and assembling cars here in Ghana, people were not so sure. But to the glory of God, now we have all the major global auto companies assembling cars here in Ghana. Volkswagen, VW, Toyota, Nissan, Kia, Hyundai, and very soon, Isuzu, Honda.

I have made a statement that I will do everything to make sure President John Mahama comes back to be President of this country and of course, he has to decide who will be his running mate. I don’t see anything wrong at all and nothing that stops Prof. Jane Naana Opoku Agyemang from being the running mate”. Ambassador Kwesi Ahwoi stated.The former Interior Minister and current Chairman of Former Ambassadors and High Commissioners under the NDC, dismissed old-age arguments against Prof.Jaane Naana Opoku Agyemang. He said Prof.Jane Naana Opoku Agyemang, can rise to become the next President after John Mahama.“People are talking about age and all. Age is not a concern. Age is being made a concern because we have a leadership today that is making age look like we have lost track. But if I tell you my age standing here you will be amazed but I have not lost track. So Naana whether she is 78, 79, or 80 can still be President of this country when President John Mahama finishes his service, that should not be a worry at all. Senior Kwabena Duffuor is putting in his cap. Kwabena Duffuor should be getting close to 79, what does he get to do with that, he got his brains, he got everything that he can use to lead this country.so I don’t see anything wrong with that(old age), Is it because Naana is a woman?” he quizzed.Ambassador Kwesi Ahwoi said it is about time women are given opportunity to rule the country given the fact that men have been tried enough.“It is about time we put a woman in charge of this country . They have a lot to offer this country. We have tried men, we’ve seen where men have taken us. Let’s try the women”.Answering a question about whether or not Prof. Jaane Naana Opoku-Agyemang, will attract more votes for the NDC when made running mate to seal the party’s victory, Kwasi Ahwoi said Central region is an amorphous region therefore the seemingly poor performance of the party in 2020 should not be a litmus test for her re-appointment as running mate.“It is the party that brings numbers it is not really the individual….if the party is strong the candidate is only a reflection of the party. But specifically, she also has her constituency, she can pull resources, and she can pull people. Most people are not calculating things well they think we lost in the central region. We lost the presidential election in Centralia Region because people forget that the central region is an amorphous region. It is not only Fantes. Central region is a combination of Ashantes, Akyems, Denkyiras just name it so don’t look at Fante and say because Naana is a Fante he should bring Central region, no! We have to go beyond that”.Prof Jane Naana Opoku-Agyemang, an academician, the first female Vice-Chancellor of the University of Cape Coast, and a former Education Minister was the running mate for the 2020 Presidential candidate of NDC John Dramani Mahama.However, lost the election to incumbent President Nana Akufo-Addo of the ruling New Patriotic Party who polled 6,730,587 represented 51.30% as against 6,213,182 vote representing 47.36% polled by John Dramani Mahama of the NDC.',\n",

The external creditors provided Ghana with a certain criterion the country must meet to secure a possible $3 billion bailout.The government introduced the Domestic Debt Exchange Program (DDEP) to restructure debt as part of the steps to reach board-level approval with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) on a $3 billion facility to restore macroeconomic stability in the country.The government targeted 80% participation in the program to help restructure 137.3 billion Ghana cedis in bonds on the domestic market to bring its total debt, which stands at about 575.5 billion Ghana cedis to sustainable levels.Speaking on Morning Starr the Political Scientist said that the government’s mismanagement of corruption is the reason we need to accept all these conditionalities from IMF for a possible bailout.“We are so excited that IMF is going to give us close to 3 billion for starters and all that. But if we manage corruption very well, I’m afraid we will not need that money with its attendant problems and conditions. Let’s look at the issue of waste and a lot of information are available within the auditor general’s report year by year. How far have we come, and how far have we learned from them to continue to see these things in our books? It is unfortunate.“If you look at issue of waste, in terms of projects we pursue. Projects that have little or no benefit for society and then we are in there. We undertake projects without records of stakeholder engagement, and when people raise their voices those projects become abandoned and we adjust to devising such projects.

Look at the way we execute contracts in this country as if there is no supervisor of contracts that the state has awarded.

There is room for everybody in the party, and at the appropriate time, we can consider them.”When asked who could possibly bring division based on what he said, he replied that “as human beings, they might not come on board and definitely, even if he had five votes, those votes are very important, but they will say that because you did not vote for their favorite, they are going to sit home.” “It is our appeal to them, and it is a strong appeal, that before they file their nominations, they should come to talk with us and take a step back.”“It should be unconditional,” he continued, “but we as a party reward ourselves; we would reward those who show love to the party; we have a mechanism for showing appreciation, but it does not come with conditions; when you come with conditions, it is not good; open your heart to do something; people will appreciate you, and we would all be winners.”',\n",

       " \"Presidential hopeful of the New Patriotic Party (NPP), Alan Kyerematen, has described the economic policies pursued over the years by several governments as a 'cul de sac.'Speaking on URA Radio in Bolgatanga in the Upper East leg of his nationwide tour, Alan Kyerematen pointed out that the narrow focus of Ghana's continued reliance on cocoa, gold, and a few primary raw material exports, is a cul de sac orientation to economic management, and which has limited growth in the economy. Doing things the same way over and over returns the same results. Cocoa, for example, has brought in under $2billion per annum into the Ghanaian economy annually over the past decades. However, the President's Special Intitiatives (PSIs), initiated by Alan Kyerematen, comprising four simple local products: salt, oil palm, cassava and garments, could have unleashed a potential combined annual income stream of $60b a year. However, policy distortion and irregular political choices reduced the nations' capacity to grow and benefit from the PSI's. Currently, the ten point strategic growth pillars developed and being implemented under Hon. Kyerematen, during his tenure as Minister for Trade and Industry, has brought in 1D1F, the automotive industry, and others. Speaking to the Great Transformational Plan  (GTP), Alan inspires that the country deserves leadership with a big vision. A vision that moves us beyond the cul de sac into strategic growth areas following through on the GTP. Alan Kyerematen is also primary to the design, establishment and implementation of the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA), which brings together a market of nearly a billion and a half consumers for producers within the diversified economy necessary to expand opportunities for the youth. On the same programme, Mr Alan Kyerematen reiterated his desire to modernise the New Patriotic Party (NPP) into a formidable force to better drive public policy and thence enable better mobilisation of communities towards opportunities. Not only will he create a businesslike Party, capable of generating independent financial, technical and human resources but also a big voice into Government appointments, especially at local level. The Upper East Region is the tenth region to have been visited by the Alan Kyerematen for President Campaign after Ashanti, Bono East, Bono, Ahafo, Western North, Volta, Eastern, Oti and Northern regions.\",\n",

Because all the ministries cannot bring their programmes to cabinet meetings so these committees collect all the programmes of ministries under them and present them during the meetings.“But when it comes to the management of the economy, it is the Economic Management Team that has been responsible for it since and nobody should run away from it,”  he said Twi.He questioned why the chairperson of the Economic Committee does not address Ghanaians on the economy if s/he is indeed superior to the head of the Economic Management Team, who is required to do so.Watch the interview below:Meanwhile, catch the latest GhanaWeb TV Election Desk interview with Francis Addai-Nimoh, as he discusses his plans to become the NPP's flagbearer, below:You can also watch this episode of People & Places on GhanaWeb TV below:IB/OGB\",\n",

They are looking for someone who will relate well with them and not have the boss, subordinate relationship.You can be from there but you are not humble enough to have time for the party members. They see Bawumia and he is like a son to the Ashantis. He endears so much to the party and they know him very well. He comes for funerals and joins most social gatherings in the region. During campaigns, he’s the one they see. You can say you are from the Ashanti Region but have the people seen you campaigning for the party in the region before?\"If you want a position in the NPP and you tell the people from Ashanti Region that they have to vote for you, what the NPP members in the Ashanti Region will ask you is when was the last time you came to Bosome Freho or Ejura to campaign. They can say that Bawumia who you claim is not from Ashanti Region 2020, 2016 campaign we were with him in the Ashanti Region.The Ashanti party is closer to Bawumia than anything. This is right from the grassroots. When we come to the Ashanti Region, you’ll get lots of the chairmen, and constituency chairmen following Vice President.Out of the number of MPs in the Ashanti Region, if any candidate apart from Bawumia is able to get more than five MPs supporting them, I will say they will win the election. Bawumia will have the support. Bawumia will get not less than 80% of the Ashanti MPs supporting him. When some persons who said they are from the Ashanti Region went back home, they had only two MPs behind them. But when Bawumia is in the Ashanti Region, he has full support from the grassroots upwards. This is an indication of who the people want. Per what I’ve seen, there’s no candidate who can command even 30% of the Ashanti Region votes apart from Bawumia,” he said.',\n",

The Accra-based senior party member and legal practitioner has consistently contested the seat in Wa Central. This is his third attempt he’s seeking to annex the seat from the incumbent Rashid Pelpuo. The information available to GhanaWeb indicates that Mr. Bampuori-Iddrrisu (Esq) is the preferred candidate for most party stakeholders and stalwarts in the constituency. According to a constituency executive, among other things, “Wahid’s consistency and commitment to party activities though he lost the primaries on two occasions is giving him some sympathy and sense of acceptance”. The source added that Wahid has a very good message that is being delivered on a clean and honest campaign. The 56-year-old legal luminary was also described as genuinely generous, friendly, and well-networked enough to lead the party in parliament. \"He was the first and only member of the NDC that has constructed and donated two party offices  which he built from his own resources to the constituency,\" the source added. The constituency seems to be drifting away from the 18 years of leadership of the incumbent and 12 years of neglect of the constituency by Hudu Mogtari to the generous lawyer and founding member of the party.

It is worth noting that the current MP is a member of the opposition National Democratic Congress (NDC), but is also the sister of the wife of the vice president, Samira Bawumia. According to Richard Nyamah, the only reason Yaw Buaben Asamoa, a one-time MP for the Adentan constituency was unable to retain that seat is because of the contributions of this powerful person, who he described as Annoh-Dompreh's preferred choice.  He said this while reacting to an earlier interview of the Majority Chief Whip in Parliament, Frank Annoh-Dompreh, on Adom TV, where the legislator dared Buaben Asamoa to win back the Adenta seat which has, for many years, been a New Patriotic Party (NPP) seat. “The Hon MP further went ahead to malign Hon Yaw Buaben Asamoa, former MP for Adentan and former Director of NPP Party Communications, now Spokesperson and Director of Communications for the Alan Kyerematen Campaign, by casting untrue aspersions on his person and character and then cheekily damning him to dare to win back the Adentan Parliamentary Seat, lost to the Party in the 2020 General elections. The real question is why and how the seat was lost. “If the Hon Annoh-Dompreh is not familiar with the story of how his preferred candidate for leadership of the NPP reportedly helped invest heavily in his brother-in-law to gift an NPP held seat to our main opponents, then he is indeed doing the High Office of Chief Whip an injustice. “It is the business of the Chief Whip to have his finger on the pulse of the Party but his aspersions in respect of Adentan Constituency show that either he is not on top of his game or that he has deliberately blinded himself to further the interests of his preferred candidate, even if the parliamentary preferences of his candidate have been hurtful to the fortunes of the NPP.  Now the question that begs answering is, will Annoh-Dompreh be singing praises to his preferred candidate if he was destooled by his brother-in-law from the NDC with the tacit support of the Vice President of the land?” he wrote. Richard Nyamah also refuted claims by the MP that Alan Kyerematen was in charge of an Economic Management Committee.

       " 'Director of Communications for the governing New Patriotic Party (NPP), Richard Ahiagbah has stated that the Akufo-Addo government is on course to restore the country’s economic stability and growth that existed before the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic.Addressing the press at the party headquarters in Aslym Down, Accra, today Wednesday 22 February 2023, Richard Ahiagbah, said the government’s Post Covid-19 Program for Economic Growth (PC-PEG) is a solid blueprint that is ushering the country out of the economic setback the people of Ghana have had to endure the last 12months.NDC’s poor recordBefore he outlined the recovery plans of the Akufo-Addo administration, Mr. Ahiagbah, took a swipe at the opposition National Democratic Congress (NDC) for what he says is a deliberate effort on the part of the opposition party to “misled many Ghanaians to think that [the Akufo-Addo government] has mismanaged the economy since assuming office”.“This claim by the NDC however is not supported by the hard economic data and the reality around the world. In all these, the NDC has not provided any credible alternative solution(s). They are talking a lot but not about solutions.  It is blame, mischaracterization, and denial of obvious global economic realities” Richard Ahiagbah said. Supporting his argument on the “poor performance” of the NDC when they were in office between 2013 and 2016, Ahiagbah said, “on the larger economy which is measured in terms of GDP the NDC, supervised a perpetual decline from 2013 to 2016”.“In 2013, GDP was 7.3%; in 2014 it was 4%; in 2015 it was 3.9% and in 2016 it was 3.7%. In terms of percentage changes in the GPD, the economy deteriorated by 45.2% in 2014 compared to 2013 growth. Similarly, the economy decreased by 2.5% in 2015 and 5.12% in 2016.“In the Real Sector, which includes Agriculture, Industry, and Service, the NDC’s performance was even worst. From 2013, real sector growth plummeted significantly across all sectors. In 2014 all the sectors grew at a negative rate using 2013 performance as a base” Mr. Ahiagbah said.“Let me remind you that this poor performance was against the NDC inheriting an economy that had discovered oil in commercial quantities and began production in 2010; which shot Ghana’s GDP to 14% in 2011.  All that growth momentum was vanquished by the NDC, led by Ex-President Mahama” he added. NPP’s outstanding performanceComparing the NDC’s performance with the NPP’s time in office before the COVID-19 pandemic and the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the NPP’s director of communications noted that available data shows that the “NPP turned around the contracting economy it inherited from the NDC in 2017 to date”.“On GDP, 2017 GDP grew at 8.1 percent compared to 3.7 percent in 2016, 2018 GDP grew by 6.3%, 2019 GDP grew by 6.5% and 2020 GDP grew by 0.5%. In the real rector, the industry recorded its highest growth of 16.7% in 2017, with Agriculture at 8.4%, and the Services sectors at 4.3%.“Industry grew from a mournful negative 0.5% in 2016 to 16.7 percent in 2017 and Services grew from 2.8% in 2016 to an appreciable 4.3% in 2017,” Ahiagbah said.“The Agric sector also grew from a dismal 2.7% in 2016 to 8.4% in 2017. Friends from the media, this data we just reviewed imply that the vulnerable in our society, the poor, indeed, the vast majority of Ghanaians fared much better under NPP in 2017. Data is sacred” he added.Recovery planAs part of the recovery plan, Mr. Ahiagbah said “Government has introduced the Post Covid-19 Program for Economic Growth (PC-PEG) to among others establish a sustainable macro-fiscal path, restore debt sustainability and macro-economic stability underpinned by key structural reform and social protection”.According to Richard Ahiagbah, “the PC-PEG will address the economic challenges of this country through fiscal consolidation, get treatment, and structural reform” and that “Government through the Central Bank has responded with a raft of monetary policy measures, including the bi-weekly FX forward auction, and the BDC forex auction which has helped subdue the pressure on the spot FX market”.“To complement the monetary policies which have been activated, the Government has subsequently announced Expenditure-led measures including a 30% cut in discretionary expenditures, a moratorium on the new creation of government units, a freeze on government travels, 30 percent cut in salaries of the executive and political appointees, among others,” Ahiagbah said.“Other policies such as the implementation of the Gold for Oil (G4O) program, implementation of the COVID-19 Alleviation & Revitalization of Enterprises Support (CARES) Program, to inject some Ghc100 billion into the economy” [are all part of the larger strategy of the government to the country’s economic stability] Ahiagbah added.“Government’s transformative agenda to digitalize the economy [which is aimed at formalizing] the Ghanaian economy & improve its administrative systems & global competitiveness, the banking sector reforms which has introduced a tighter regulatory & supervisory framework in the sector are all part of the steps government is taking to revive the economy.“Through these innovative measures, the government is demonstrating its resolve to build back the economy quickly and restore fiscal rectitude. Government’s commitment to these measures is a clear assurance that we are on the right track and capable of causing a turnaround of the economy with the resolute support of all Ghanaians” Richard Ahiagbah further stated.Way Forward for EconomyIn his press statement, the NPP\\'s director of communications identified several thematic areas that the government is paying attention to tackle the prevailing economic challenges.Mr. Ahiagbah noted that in 2022, the government introduced a raft of fiscal and monetary measures to rein in expenditures and improve revenue mobilization, including a cut in discretionary spending, a cut in the salaries of the executives, a freeze on foreign travel, among others\".\"The 2023 budget indicates the government’s desire to continue fiscal consolidation efforts and reduce the fiscal deficit in line with the pending IMF Programme. The government expects to record one of the lowest deficits this year, much lower than the GH¢64.0 billion announced in the 2023 budget\" Ahiagbah said.\"Expenditure measures, the debt treatment program, and structural reforms, among others, are all measures that the Akufo-Addo administration has embarked on to ensure that the economy is stabilized and subsequently made to grow as was the case before the COVID-19 pandemic\" Ahiagbah added.',\n",
       " 'The Director of Communications of the governing New Patriotic Party (NPP) has stated that the party is unperturbed by the decision of former president John Dramani Mahama to run for president in the 2024 general elections.Richard Ahiagbah told press men (February 22) that having defeated Mahama twice (in 2016 and 2020), the NPP has no fears facing him for a third consecutive time.“We have beaten him twice, so you just conclude for yourself if we are afraid of him. It is all mathematical, and we have defeated him twice. He is even afraid to plainly declare whether he is going to contest or not. We are ready for him.”According to Ahiagbah, the NPP\\'s major preoccupation now is to improve the economy and ease the cost of living crisis that citizens have been faced with for the past few months.“We are interested in how we can build our economy, and we want to know whether he has the solution because we saw him vanquish the gains that he got, and we saw him collapse our economy and banking sector. \"He doesn’t have what it takes to improve Ghana because if he had what it took to do that, he wouldn’t have vanquished our economic gains and taken us to the IMF,” he stressed.Mahama declares bid, picks nomination formsMahama\\'s formal intention to run for a third consecutive shot at the presidency was reported when a number of NDC MPs confirmed that he was going to contest.On February 22, forms were picked on his behalf by Prof. Alabi and regional chairmen amid fanfare.

Other than that, it will be politically suicidal for the NPP in the 2024 general election”, he added.Describing him as the choice for all, Nana Busia said “as a great party we can’t overlook our political history and pick any wrong choice to lead us because posterity would not spare us if we do so”.',\n",
       " 'The General Secretary of the Convention People’s Party (CPP), Nana Yaa Jantuah has hit hard at the NPP government for keeping Finance Minister, Ken Ofori-Atta, in office months after the country’s economy deteriorated.The former Public Affairs Director for the Public Utilities Regulatory Commission (PURC) who was speaking on Power FM’s Inside Politics programme wondered why the minister was still in office after Ghana borrowed so hugely in a debt distress level.“Ken Ofori-Atta abon [Ken Ofori-Atta is incompetent],” she said in Akan while explaining that the finance minister is highly incompetent and unintelligent for allowing the economy to slowly grind to a halt amid warnings from experts.“When I call them F9 (unintelligent) ministers people want to come after me but that is who they are: non-performing ministers,” she argued.Yaa Jantuah said times are hard that the working class and the ordinary people cannot afford a 3 square meal which was possible before the NPP took over power in 2017.The hardship, she explained, was as a result of the inflationary spiral fuelled by a steep depreciation of the cedi which was not managed for a long time.To her, President Akufo-Addo should have sacked Ofori-Atta long before the economy got crushed to a point that the country cannot pay for its domestic and external debts.Experts and rating agents have described Ghana’s economy as one that is in a huge debt crisis.Finding a way to handle the government’s debts internationally, Finance Minister Ofori-Atta recently disclosed that the government has initiated talks with China over Ghana’s debt following a successful Domestic Debt Exchange Programme (DDEP).He told Citi News that negotiations with China are important because China holds the majority of the external bonds, stressing that he was to lead a delegation to China to plead for debt cancellation.“The big elephant in the room is China, we will be visiting China by the end of the week to really discuss how they come into the envelope as quickly as possible. So we are looking at that support from them. China represents about a third of the $5.7 billion loan and so it is important that we engage them,” he said.Nana Yaa Jantuah believes Ghana should not have degraded to a level that a team that mocked the previous government for going for an IMF bailout will now be drowned in debt borne out of mismanagement.He partly blamed the nepotistic nature of President Akufo-Addo who is related to Ofori-Atta for the economic mess which she said had plunged the country into hunger.',\n",

We had disagreements with Mahama when he was in power. But based on what we’ve seen so far, from Nana Addo, we’ll conclude that he’s clueless, incompetent, and lacks the qualifications to be president”.When asked if they were not doing this because they are NDC members, he recalled how they supported the NPP in 2016 and was asked if they were NPP members at the time.“We had a better life under Mahama. He far outperformed Nana Addo. Today is difficult for us. We have come to regret voting for the NPP. Ghanaians are currently facing economic hardship. Ghanaians are struggling. \"We cannot afford the high cost of gasoline. Things are challenging. Businesses are struggling. We know that supporting Mahama is the best option.

According to the flagbearer-hopeful of the ruling New Patriotic Party (NPP), although it appears some of the personalities who have also indicated their intentions to run for the vacant role in the party are ‘bigger’ than him, that is not what will win them the elections. He explained that it takes such attributes as character and endearment to be able to win the hearts of the delegates of the party. “Big names do not win elections. Elections are won by your character, by your good self – endearing yourself to the electorates, articulating your vision and they having the acceptability for you that you could be, and you are qualified to be their leader; not necessarily any name as such,” he explained. Speaking with GhanaWeb TV’s Etsey Atisu in an interview on Election Desk, Francis Addai-Nimoh recalled how, for instance, he out-performed many more experienced names in the party during the 2014 presidential primaries of the NPP. He said that because of the confidence the delegates have in him, he came out third in that race, even though he was regarded as the underdog in the race. “Similarly, in 2014, when the seven contestants, and I was one of them, I was seen to be the underdog; I was seen to be someone unknown in the political environment of our country. The other six contestants had all worked under J. A. Kufuor’s administration either as ministers of state, or deputy ministers of state, and Addai-Nimoh had not been in that position before. “But when we went through that process in 2014, I came in third, which was an enviable position that I secured for myself, and that shows the potential that the NPP delegates found in me and then encouraged me to make progress with this ambition,” he added.

Dr Butakor said he is an indigene and grassroots person who is well-known across the constituency adding that his experience coupled with humility, connectedness and resourcefulness will be able to attract floating voters and votes of the majority of disgruntled NPP supporters due to the abysmal performance of the NPP over the years.

He appealed to delegates of the NDC to trust him with their votes since he is the right person to wrestle power from the NPP and lead to total dominance of the NDC in the constituency.Dr Butakor currently teaches Quantitative Research Methods, Educational Measurement and Assessment, and Statistics at both undergraduate and graduate levels.He holds PhD (Measurement, Evaluation, and Statistics) from the University of Alberta, Canada; an MSc in Applied Statistics from Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology; as well as MSc in Educational Sciences, from the University of Groningen, The Netherlands.The Nsawam-Adoagyiri constituency was created out of the Aburi-Nsawam constituency in the Eastern Region of Ghana.

Adomako Mensah claims the party has been determining the psoition that the Minority Caucus takes on governmental issues before they can decide on the next course of action.In an interview with Wontumi TV, he suggested that measures should be taken to prevent the party's leadership from meddling in parliamentary duties since doing so would interfere with the administration's ability to function effectively.“Now we all know that the NDC party is run by the headquarters. Every morning, Fifi Kwetey will write a letter and direct that all of you should toe this line. “They did the same thing to Huruna. They sacked him. All of us know that there was no NEC meeting, nothing, and they removed them.“First vetting of the new leadership…then the General Secretary writes a letter that they shouldn’t accept all of the nominees.“So, it has become very clear that the party is being run from the headquarters including the MPs. That’s my worry, if we don’t take care, Adabraka, the party’s head office might have so much influence. “Don’t forget that the current chairman of the party sits on the parliamentary service board…I mean that kind of conflict of interest is very strange…you can imagine Aseidu Nketia’s contributions during their council meeting. “So, as I said, the party is being run from the headquarters, Aseidu Nketia and Fifi Kwetey, write letters and direct them on what they should do,” he added.

Madam Hayibor, who is a former Research Assistant interacting with the media, said the NDC was the best Party in developing the Hohoe Constituency as well as the nation in general and she was ready to carry the mantle. “Having more women in decision-making rooms such as parliament had significantly improved our economy and the world.” “Decision-making is always better when women are at the table, and this is also essential for the functioning and effective democracy.” She said she had served the Party in the Constituency, region and nation, while also being an active party member abroad. Madam Hayibor said she had fulfilled all her financial obligations to the Party in the quest for her development of the Party at home.   She noted that politics was a tool for development, and it was time for the youth to be part of the development and must play active roles to support the adults.  Madam Hayibor said contributing her quota to the Party in the Constituency was borne out of the experiences she acquired through her political life.  She said she believed the economic empowerment of women, which could be secured through laws, can help solve the global economic crisis, especially in Ghana and the world at large. Madam Hayibor said her position as a Women Organiser of the Party in Scotland led to the adoption of party Branches in the Hohoe Constituency for support as well as played key roles in the 2020 general elections in Hohoe. “I believe one of the ways to stand up for the marginalised in societies is to join the discussion tables and represent the views of the minorities and be the voice for the voiceless in society.”',\n",

Addai-Nimoh urged the Finance Minister to compare the number of pensioners who have government bonds and the quantum of their investment with the investments of other financial institutions, such as banks and insurance companies.“At the beginning, my position on the issue was for the Finance Minister to provide the number of pensioners who have government bonds. Then the quantum of their investment. It was later that I realized the investment was around 2.2b. So compare that figure with the others, the banks, the insurance companies, and others. Then ask what the effect will be if the pensioners are exempted or added. “For me, it was just simple,” he said.However, Ing. Addai-Nimoh stressed the importance of transparency in the decision-making process, saying that the Finance Minister needs to provide the public with the necessary information so they can make informed decisions and trustIng. Addai-Nimoh believes that if the Finance Minister can provide the public with the necessary information, Ghanaians will be more willing to support efforts to address the country’s debt crisis. Ultimately, transparency will be key to winning the hearts of Ghanaians, according to the aspiring flagbearer of the NPP.“When he said we needed to help him for him to help us, that was a good statement. But then submit the spare sheets with the figures, bring them to the public so that we can understand why pensioners are in there, and with that, we can determine where the effects are insignificant or not. “Without it, they can’t trust you,” he said.“They have been exempted, and it’s refreshing to know, but we shouldn’t have dragged this issue to where we go.” The figures should have been provided so we know how much the financial institutions and their investments in government bonds total. So, if we decide to exempt pensioners and the consequences are minimal and we can still manage the debt situation, why not exempt them? “”Since they’ve been exempted, I’d commend them for standing their ground and expressing their displeasure,” he added.',\n",

Parliament’s Appointments Committee will, on Monday, February 20, 2023, start vetting ministers and deputy minister-nominees recently announced by President Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo. The nominees to appear before the committee include Member of Parliament (MP) for Adansi Asokwa, K.T. Hammond, the Minister-designate for Trade and Industry and the MP for Nhyiaeso, Stephen Amoah (Sticka) who would be serving as his deputy. MP for Abetifi, Bryan Acheampong was also nominated as the Minister for Food and Agriculture while Stephen Asamoah Boateng is going to the Chieftaincy and Religious Affairs Ministry as minister. Karaga MP, Mohammed Amin Adam was named by the president as Minister of State at the Finance Ministry while Herbert Krapah was nominated deputy Minister for Energy. It is based on this that the NDC has cautioned its member against approving new ministerial nominees. “The leadership of the NDC, has, against this backdrop, directed the Minority caucus in Parliament NOT to approve any of the new ministerial nominees and to further push for a reduction in the size of government with a view to reducing the needless drain on scarce public resources. “In this moment of haircuts, the most important thing the government can do is to do a \"governmental  haircut\". Our directive to the minority in parliament, we believe strongly aligns with the genuine sentiments of most Ghanaians,” the statement said.Below is the statement  PRESS RELEASE For Immediate Release February 19, 2023 STATEMENT ON VETTING AND APPROVAL OF NEW MINISTERIAL NOMINEES. The NDC has long expressed concern over the very large size of the current government and shares the views of most Ghanaians, including Civil Society, that it must be reduced bearing in mind the current massive economic mess, the country has been plunged into by the Akufo-Addo/ Bawumia government. Despite numerous appeals, President Akufo Addo has quite characteristically, remained adamant and tone deaf. The leadership of the NDC, has, against this backdrop, directed the Minority caucus in Parliament NOT to approve any of the new ministerial nominees and to further push for a reduction in the size of government with a view to reducing the needless drain on scarce public resources. In this moment of haircuts, the most important thing the government can do is to do a \"governmental  haircut\". Our directive to the minority in parliament, we believe strongly aligns with the genuine sentiments of most Ghanaians. Enough is enough. Signed. Hon. Fifi Fiavi Kwetey General Secretary YNA/DA',\n",

       " 'A former executive of the Tema East constituency branch of the opposition National Democratic Congress (NDC), Stephen Ashitey Adjei, has accused former President Mahama of using empty promises of juicy appointments to deceive gurus of the party.In the latest of his writings on happenings in the party, Mr. Ashitey Adjei, who is popularly called Moshake, accused the former President of secretly enticing some leading figures of the party with ministerial appointments to win them over.“It is not only Ministerial appointments, even the running mate position, Mr. Mahama is playing lotto with it by promising multiple people that he will make them running Mate,” Moshake wrote.The accusation is the latest by Moshake who has been rubbing Mr. Mahama’s nose into his past mistakes which he says led to the NDC losing power twice in 2016 and 2020.His write-up which is one in a series that he has been putting out since 2020 comes as the NDC slowly builds up toward a congress to elect its flagbearer for the 2024 presidential election.Like all other salvos that Moshake has released, this one is bound to rub Mr. Mahama sore because of the facts that Moshake characteristically laces with his punches.and the write-up is coming at a time that many in the NDC are tired of the Mahama brand and are looking for a fresh face to lead the NDC which has been under the Mahama influence since 2012.The former constituency executive accuses Mr. Mahama of, “promising positions like confetti to NDC gurus just to win their favour for the upcoming presidential primary.”However, he vows that, “no empty promise will yield the loyalties of anybody because every single person in the NDC knows how neglectful John Mahama is. We remember how Mahama snubbed NDC members and appointed strangers like Raymond Atuguba, Nayong Billy Joe Alhassan Azong and others when he became president.”He called on, “all the executives that Mahama has promised the positions to reject his indecent proposal out of hand to show him he John Mahama cannot deceive any NDC guru with the promise of position.”Meanwhile, Moshake has urged the party’s delegates to, “get with the wind of change and vote massively for Dr. Kwabena Duffuor to lead the party in 2024.”',\n",

       " ' Member of Parliament for Dome Kwabenya, Sarah Adwoa Safo has made her first appearance in parliament since the House resumed sitting on February 7, 2023. The third session of the eighth Parliament resumed on February 7, 2023, after the house went on break for Christmas and new festivities. Following the resumption of the house, Adwoa Safo did not make any appearance in the chamber even though she was in the country. Adwoa Safo’s absence from parliament was one of the most discussed topics in the country in 2022. The discussion came on the back of her leaving the country after the 2022 budget was passed on November 26, 2021. However, on November 11 2022, Adwoa Safo officially resumed her parliamentary duties following her return from the United States of America. Speaker of Parliament, Alban Bagbin, on October 26, 2022, ruled that the report of the committee set up to look into her case and that of two other MPs who absented themselves for a number of sittings should be presented before the whole house for a debate. Alban Bagbin dismissed the objection of the Majority Leader, Osei Kyei-Mensah-Bonsu, to the admissibility of the committee report for the consideration of the house. “As I have noted in this ruling, the decision (sic) on not to admit a motion is the exclusive preserve of the Speaker. In view of the foregoing, the House is well within its right to receive and consider reports of the committee and make a determination arising out of the consideration. “In the circumstances, it is my ruling that the motion was rightfully admitted and the report of the committee is subject to the consideration of the house. It goes without saying that the (sic) objection of the Majority Leader today (sic) is hereby dismissed…” he concluded his verdict. YNA/KPE',\n",
       " 'The Campaign Team of Mr Alan Kyerematen, a flagbearer hopeful of the New Patriotic Party (NPP) has urged the Party to hold its presidential primaries early to offer the prospective leader adequate time to prepare for the 2024 general election. The Team has also appealed to the Party’s leadership to allow aspirants to campaign ahead of the date for the primaries to offer them enough time to engage with delegates. In an interview with the Ghana News Agency, Mr Yaw Buaben Asamoa, Spokesperson for Mr Kyerematen’s Campaign, said the Camp would prefer the presidential primaries to be held in either August or September this year. “We believe that the earlier the date, the better. If we are to succeed ourselves as an administration, then it is important that we have the next potential President early so that the President can influence public policy going forward,” he said. Mr Asamoa said if elected earlier, the flagbearer would have the opportunity to make input in the priorities and budgets of the Government in a manner that would positively affect the chances of the Party in the next general election. He said the Party’s delegates also needed enough time to meet with the aspirants and assess their capabilities, hence the need for the Party to allow the aspirants to campaign ahead of their nomination. “If the nomination process is delaying because the Party cannot fix the date for the election, then it is difficult for the candidate and the Party itself because that space could be filled with activity between delegates and potential candidates,” Mr Asamoa said. The NPP is yet to announce a date for its presidential and parliamentary primaries. The Party’s National Council met in Accra earlier this month to decide on the date for the primaries, but the meeting was reported to have ended inconclusively. The Party said it would engage broadly on the issue to arrive at a consensus. Per the NPP’s Constitution, the Party must elect its presidential candidate 11 months before the general election, when it is in power. Mr Kyerematen, who has been working towards becoming President since 207, resigned as Minister of Trade and Industry last month to pursue his presidential ambition. He officially announced his decision to contest the NPP flagbearership race in an address on January 10, 2023. In that address, Mr Kyerematen said the country required a new plan to build a self-reliant economy to avoid going back to the International Monetary Fund in future. He said if he succeeded in his quest to become President in the next general election, he would launch and lead the execution of the Great Transformational Plan of Ghana, which would span the period 2025 to 2030 to revamp key sectors of the economy. Mr Asamoa said Mr Kyerematen had so far toured the Ashanti, Bono East, Bono, Ahafo, Western North, Volta, and Eastern regions, where he met chiefs and delegates to officially inform them about his decision to contest the NPP flagbearership race. “Everywhere we have been, there is the feeling that Mr Kyerematen is the right man in the right place for the right job,” he said.',\n",
       " 'Mr. Gabriel Kwamigah-Atokple Tanko, a businessperson and National Welfare Committee member of the National Democratic Congress (NDC), is lacing his boots to make a second attempt at the Parliamentary primaries of the party in the Ketu North Constituency. He contested the primaries in 2019 but lost to incumbent Dr James Klutse Avedzi. The aspirant, who has been touring the various branches of the NDC in the constituency ahead of the party’s Presidential and Parliamentary primaries slated for May, this year, made his intentions known in an interview with the Ghana News Agency at Dzodze. According to the business executive and professional who has served in various capacities in the NDC both in the Ketu North Constituency and at the national level and a member of the Volta and Ketu North Finance Committees of the party, he was compelled by the dream to usher in a new dawn for the NDC in Ketu North. The hopeful as affectionately called Tanko as he is affectionately believes there can be no better replacement for the incumbent Member of Parliament (MP) Dr. James Klutse Avedzi who has hinted of his decision not to run for the position again, than him (Tanko).  “My passion and effort to contribute to the development of our constituency is paramount- the evidence can be seen across the Constituency since my civil service days- I am ready and prepared for the job like no other,” he said. Mr Tanko, who is sure of winning the Ketu North NDC parliamentary primaries, intends to unite the party when he wins the constituency and national election.The seat is being eyed by Edem Agbana, the immediate past deputy National Communications officer of the party.  He advised all parliamentary primary hopefuls against a campaign of insults, attacks, and acrimony, which sometimes characterised political competitions and called for a change of the status quo. “It’s imperative that we avoid politics of insults and attacks on one another and rather focus on the messages we have as aspirants for the Branch Executives in the interest of peace and harmony going forward,” he advised. Mr Tanko said his tour of the constituency affirms his commitment of prosecuting an issue-based campaign devoid of character assassinations, and all other unhealthy discourses that may frustrate intended reconciliation activities after the elections in the Ketu North constituency. “The gate of my house remains open to all NDC faithful, who truly seek the progress of our beloved constituency,” Tanko added as he campaigns on a message of  “New Dawn” (NUBUKƐ).',\n",

We are seeking to win a third consecutive general election. We are seeking to break the eight that has so far eluded the two major political parties in the fourth republic.“Obviously, to achieve this extraordinary and unprecedented feat, we need to do the extraordinary. We cannot do the same things we’ve been doing from 1992 and expect to achieve a different result, more so, when the result in question, is one that no political party in Ghana has been able to achieve. This consciousness is what I expect to drive our 2024 project. We must all be conscious of the enormity of the task ahead of us to be able to work our hearts out towards its realization,” Chairman Ntim said while addressing a Retreat by the Council of Elders of the Greater Accra Region branch of the party at Peduase in Aburi.He added that the target of the current national executives is to ensure victory for the NPP come 2024 and nothing will stop them from achieving this objective.“Consistent with our mandate, we, as national officers, following our election in July 2022, set for ourselves, a target of working assiduously to retain power in 2024 to justify the confidence that had been reposed in us by the party’s delegates. This particular commitment to delivering nothing but victory to the party come 2024, has, at all times, been our primary focus in everything we do.”',\n",

She made these remarks while reacting to the government’s decision to include certain individuals in its domestic debt exchange programme. “By God’s grace, Covid is not a blessing but it is a blessing in disguise because when Covid came Ghanaians had a lot of benefits from the Covid. “So, if you’re a prudent government, couldn't you have invested the Covid money and we wouldn’t have even been here chasing the IMF for just 3 billion. “Whereby you had over 21 billion from the Covid fund. What did you do with the money? The Ministry of Information paid over 1.51 billion old cedis to themselves as risk allowance. So, the government has no vision for us,” she said. Meanwhile, the Minister of Finance, Ken Ofori-Atta, has calmed the nerves of pensioner bondholders, insisting that the government will not shortchange their legitimate rights but will honour their coupon payments and maturing principals, like all government bondholders.He told Parliament that the government remained committed to the well-being and dignity of the senior citizens and pensioners.On the other hand, President Akufo-Addo has also stated that the government’s debt exchange programme (DEP) was fraught with several challenges after its announcement, but it has largely been accepted by the citizenry.He made this known when the German Federal Minister of Finance, Christian Lindner, paid him a visit at the Jubilee House.

He has no Godfather, that’s all. So they do all those evil and call it Mafia. And somebody speak out with joy to say we have played him mafia.” Mr Kwadwo Nuamah told Kwame Tanko on Angel FM Kumasi in an interview monitored by MyNewsGH.com.He further revealed that, the source of such power struggle in the party is mostly the fight between an MP and CEO of a government agency.“The issue of fight between CEO and MPs is very brutal, and it brings some kind of hatred to you. A typical example is myself. I was in the UK, sold my house, came down and did campaign. I had a 90% win in the constituency which is unprecedented, that after elections, every 9 people out of 10 will vote for you, it has never happened. The party should have even contacted me and learn how I was able to do that”, Mr Kwadwo Nuamah narrated.The former lawmaker indicated that in most cases, people who are engaged in such mafia style do not build proper relationship with the party people at the grassroots.In the 2016 Parliamentary election in Kwadaso Constituency in the Ashanti Region, Hon Samiu Kwadwo Nuamah polled 61,631 representing 90.0% while the NDC candidate Monica Bawuah had 6,263 representing 9.2% of the total votes cast.In 2004 NPP candidate had, 83.2 with NDC 13.6, 2008 NPP polled 82.7% NDC 15.3%, whiles in 2012 the NPP Had 83.6% and polling NDC 14.5%.Mr Kwadwo Nuamah was succeeded by incumbent MP for the constituency Dr. Kingsley Nyarko in 2020.',\n",

The MPs believe that Dr. Bawumia is the best bet to lead the party, and I have no doubt in my mind that he will emerge victorious,” he said.The Sefwi Akontombra MP dropped a hint that all the MPs canvassing support for the Vice President will soon come forward to unveil the cloak of anonymity for the public to know and recognise them.“We’ll be addressing a press conference to declare our support as MPs for the Vice President very soon. Dr. Bawumia is a Vice President who has shown majority and capability that he is the only person who can lead the NPP to break the eight,” he disclosed.Touching on the delegates, Mr. Djornobuah mentioned that about 80 per cent of the delegates would vote for the Vice President.“I know and believe that Western North, we’ll not disappoint the Vice President because it is time for us to reciprocate what he has done for us.

According to him, the NPP knows how to damage the Mahama brand and that having him in the saddle will be inimical to the chances of the NDC. According to him, “the agenda is nothing new, but in the same cast as the old plot to make Mr. Mahama, with all of his baggage of past scandals, become flagbearer again so that the NPP can have an easy campaign,” he wrote.The NPP government has failed miserably and will be going into the 2024 election campaigns as underdogs. However, if they were to have somebody like Mr. Mahama as the NDC’s flagbearer, then the NPP would simply arch back and repeat their successful campaigns in 2016 and 2020, in which Mahama was framed as the most incompetent man to have governed the country, again.Many people in the party, including Moshake, have been fighting to ensure this dirty old trick of the NPP does not repeat successfully in 2024.“In 2020, we were here when the NPP’s Ashanti regional Chairman, Bernard Antwi Boasiako, alias Wontumi, revealed that Mahama had been ordered to contest as flagbeaerer so that the NPP can easily beat him.“Similarly, we were here when the Tema West constituency Chairman of the NPP at the time, Dennis Amfo-Sefah, alias Nana Boakye, also ordered Mahama to run and when he did we lost by over 500,000 votes,” Moshake wrote.He added, “they are trying to repeat the same trick and Mahama has agreed to be the point man again. However, our promise is that we will resist this with everything we have because 2024 is not only about the fate of the NDC, but a mission to rescue Ghana.”He called on NDC delegates to, “frustrate the NPP plan by massively voting to elect Dr, Kwabena Duffuor\\xa0as\\xa0flagbearer.”',\n",

Solomon Kusi Appiah also explained that President Akufo-Addo stands head and shoulders above all former leaders of the Fourth Republic in an interview with Onua FM.“Let’s be honest to ourselves, see, since Nana Addo Dankwa came, the good works that he’s doing and the help that he’s offering to Ghanaians is something good to write home about...Nana Addo Dankwa will go down as the best statesman ever in the history of this country under the First, Second, Third and Fourth Republics because when you check the good works that Nana Addo is doing, it is so remarkable,“ he said. Meanwhile, the government is seeking a programme with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) with the view to salvage the economy which suffered a torrid 2022 characterised by a depreciating currency, galloping inflation and a general increase in the cost of living.According to President Akufo-Addo, though the government's debt exchange programme(DDP) was fraught with several challenges after its announcement, it has largely been accepted by the citizenry.He made this known when the German Federal Minister of Finance, Christian Lindner, paid him a visit at the Jubilee House.

If that was not his responsibility, he needed to be very careful. People were singing his praises while he was taking those actions but that was not his directly job to do.

       " 'Some National Democratic Congress (NDC) executives in the Tema West constituency of the Greater Accra Region have added their voices to calls asking that the party shelve Parliamentary primaries in Tema East and let the incumbent MP go unopposed.In a statement released Wednesday in Accra, the Tema West executives reiterated reasons already put out by their Tema East counterparts for Isaac Ashai Odamtten to be retained.“We are totally agreeable to the observation that holding a Parliamentary primary in Tema East will be a waste of money because Hon. Ashai Odamtten will easily win, however, beyond this, it is absolutely important that we all contribute to efforts to protect the one constituency in the whole of Tema that the NDC has,” the statement said.The statement was signed by Mr. Kofi Mensah, a thoroughbred party man, on behalf of the executives of the constituency.It is coming in the wake of a similar call by executives of the Tema East constituency branch of the party who have vowed to vote skirt and blouse if the national leadership of the party do not ensure that Isaac Ashai Odamtten is not re-elected for 2024.Prior to the vow by the Tema East Constituency executives, Senior Prelate of Faith Chapel International, Apostle Dr. Eric Emefa Agbogedenu had been the first to make the call for Ashai Odamtten to be maintained by the NDC, citing his outstanding performance in office.The Tema Metropolis has three constituencies – Tema West, Tema Central and Tema East – and all of the three have for a long time been dominated by the ruling New Patriotic Party (NPP).This was the case until 2020 when Isaac Ashai Odamtten burst onto the scene and unseated the NPP’s MP for Tema East, Daniel Nii Kwartei Titus Glover.“When you have a bird in hand, you don’t put it back on a tree and then go and set up a trap again. You keep it. We are asking our party’s national leadership to keep this bird in hand by canceling any plans to hold parliamentary primaries in Tema East,” the statement said.It said, “This will save us from wasting precious resources that we can use to fund the 2024 national elections itself.”For those who think that not holding primaries will be disrespectful to the constitution, the executives pointed out that, “The law was made for man and not man for the law.”Meanwhile, the executives have thanked Apostle Dr. Dr. Eric Emefa Agbogedenu for initiating the first conversation on the matter.',\n",
       " 'A Youth group calling itself Project 24 who are supporters of Alan Kyerematen’s bid to lead the New Patriotic Party (NPP) into the 2024 elections and subsequently lead Ghana as President have responded to claims that Alan Kyerematen believes that the Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo led government has failed.Alan Kyerematen\\'s has come under fire for saying the Country is in hard times making it difficult to craft a campaign message for the governing NPP ahead of the 2024 elections.This is after statements made by Alan whilst addressing a meeting of Chiefs and Elders at the Sefwi Wiawso Traditional Council during his campaign tour.Alan said, \"We are in hard times, something every truthful person can attest to\".He also went ahead to say that, \"We have worked but because of the challenging times we are in, it is becoming difficult for us the NPP to craft a message for the 2024 elections”.But his comments have been taken out of context to mean that the Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo government of which he was a part had failed the people of Ghana.A statement from Project24; a youth group supporting Alan’s bid to be the NPP flagbearer described comments on Alan’s address to Sefwi Wiawso Chiefs as vile propaganda and an attempt to soil a man without blemish in the political space.The group in their statement noted that since Ghana’s economic woes worsened, several party leaders including the President have attested to the hardship and have blamed it on the twin disasters including COVID-19, and Russia - Ukraine war just as Alan Kyerematen spoke about.To them, it is therefore shocking that Alan Kyerematen’s attempt to reiterate what the President and the Vice President have always said has been taken out of context and is been interpreted as saying Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo’s government has failed.“Alan is making a political bid to lead the NPP, and it is obvious that he will never make an utterance that even implies the failure of an existing NPP government. Alan is relying on his political experience to justify his bid for flagbearership and subsequently presidency. With the most recent 6 years of that rich political experience coming from this current government, it is illogical to assume that Alan will condemn the government. It opens himself up in view of the impeccable role he played in the government for 6 years. It must also be put on the record that Alan has been the most industrious trade minister this country has ever seen as evidenced with his role in the realization of the African Continental Free Trade Area and the establishment of over 290 factories across the country. This is simply epic,” their statement read.',\n",
       " \"The office of the Member of Parliament for Sissala East, Amidu Chinnia Issahaku, has reiterated his stance on the matter of the removal of the immediate-past Minority Leader, Haruna Iddrisu, from a number of committees in parliament. Fuseini Abdul-Fatawu, the Research Assistant to the New Patriotic Party (NPP) MP, told GhanaWeb in an email, that it is false that his boss has apologized for his statement above. Earlier, GhanaWeb reported that Amidu Chinnia led some MPs to indicate that it was unfair how the former Minority Leader was being treated.They pointed at two major issues to buttress their concerns, the first being his removal from seven committees of the House by virtue of having lost his leadership position.“Haruna Iddrisu as Minority Leader, by virtue of his removal, he has been removed from several committees of which he was serving on. Appointments, Business, Inter Parliamentary Union, Standing Orders Committees among others,” the group spokesman lamented.He added that the issue of attempts to remove him from his office amounted to “a case of humiliation to the MPs and their constituents,” referring to Haruna and his Chief Whip, Mohammed-Mubarak Muntaka.The MP also slammed the National Democratic Congress, accusing the party of betraying two major voter blocs of the party, the northern regions and the Zongos (Muslim dominated areas), by virtue of removing Haruna and Muntaka.“The five northern regions at least should have been represented, the Zongo communities in Ghana which contributes significantly to the votes of the NDC should have been represented. These changes took away Haruna Iddrisu from the North, it took away Muntaka, a Zongo man.“Zongo representation and northern leadership has been taken away and which is a complete disrespect,” he stressed.However, in an update from GhanaWeb's parliamentary correspondent, Nimatu Yakubu Atouyese, she said that the new Minority Chief Whip, Kwame Governs Agbodza, said on Friday, February 10, 2023, that the Sissala East MP apologized for his comments, regretting that his statements were mere political talk. But in a response to this claim, the Research Assistant to the Sissala East MP, Fuseini Abdul-Fatawu, stressed that no such apology has been made by his boss. “The attention of Hon. Amidu Chinnia Issahaku, MP for the Sissala East constituency and Deputy Minister of Sanitation and Water Resources, have been drawn to the fact that an apology is attributed to him in the above story. “The honourable MP of the Sissala East constituency wish to state that he hasn't issued any apology to any Minority MP or their leadership. “For the avoidance of doubt, Hon. Amidu Chinnia Issahaku and the NPP MPs from the Northern Regions and Zongo communities wish to re-emphasize that the treatment given to Hon. Haruna Iddrisu was unfair, unjust and undemocratic. Thank you,” he stated. Haruna Iddrisu has been at the center of a lot of parliamentary discussions in the last week after he was ousted as the Minority Leader, a change that has brought to question a number of major re-adjustments in the House.

I also charged the Cape Coast South Constituency Youth Wing and all youths across the country to be rest assured that they are the generational pillars of the NPP the Youth Wing under the able leadership of Commander General Salam Mustapha and he will do everything to protect their interest always.”“I also did a brief 2020 data analysis of the constituency to the effect that the constituency is a battleground constituency per the national criteria.

The parliamentary results also revealed that only 13 polling stations are NPP stronghold whilst NDC has 16 stronghold polling stations. With the rest being battleground polling stations.

       " 'The National Chairman of the governing New Patriotic Party, Mr Stephen Ntim has assured the Greater Accra Regional Council of Elders of the NPP and the entire party that the leadership of the NPP will ensure a free and fair election towards the upcoming election of a flagbearer to lead the party into election 2024.Speaking at a brainstorming session by the Council of Elders of the Greater Accra Region at Peduase in Aburi, the Chairman stated that even though the party is yet to set a date for the congress and election of its flagbearer and parliamentary candidates, their national executives are in vigorous preparation to ensure a free, fair, clean and successful primary.Responding to concerns by some members of the council on those who are flouting the code of conduct in the campaigning, the chairman was emphatic that the code of ethics is still in force and thus cautioned prospective aspirants to abide by them as no date has been set yet for the elections.Here is the full statement from Mr Stephen NtimSTATEMENT BY THE NATIONAL CHAIRMAN OF THE NPP, MR. STEPHEN AYESU NTIM AT A RETREAT ORGANIZED BY THE GREATER ACCRA REGIONAL COUNCIL OF ELDERS ON FEBRUARY 11, 2023.Chairman and members of the Greater Accra Regional Council of Elders, I stand on existing protocols to, first of all, bring you greetings from the National leadership of the Party, and to commend you for putting together this important Retreat. I do not recall a retreat of this nature organized by any of our regional council of elders and so, I commend you for setting this pace and hope that other organs of the party particularly at the regional levels would emulate this enviable example.The choice of the theme for this occasion: “Effective Party Organization To Break The Eight” is spot on and worthy of commendation. Indeed, I dare say, there couldn’t have been a better theme looking at the times we find ourselves at a Party. We are seeking to do something no political party in the history of this country has been able to do. We are seeking to win a third consecutive general election. We are seeking to break the eight that have so far eluded the two major political parties in the fourth republic.Obviously, to achieve this extraordinary and unprecedented feat, we need to do the extraordinary. We cannot do the same things we’ve been doing since 1992 and expect to achieve a different result, more so, when the result in question, is one that no political party in Ghana has been able to achieve. This consciousness is what I expect to drive our 2024 project. We must all be conscious of the enormity of the task ahead of us to be able to work our hearts out towards its realization.Consistent with our mandate, we, as national officers, following our election in July 2022, set for ourselves, a target of working assiduously to retain power in 2024 to justify the confidence that had been reposed in us by the party’s delegates. This particular commitment to delivering nothing but victory to the party come 2024, has, at all times, been our primary focus in everything we do.We began by appointing hardworking party members to serve as deputy national officers, directors at the national secretariat and members of the various committees of the Party to help us effectively deliver on our mandate. Of course, we can only be successful on this mandate if we get the support and cooperation of the members of our Party. More importantly, we can only succeed in our mandate when we continue to receive wise counsel from the members of our council of elders from the constituency to regional and national levels to put us on track at all times.As members of the council of elders, the wisdom and advice you offer us is so crucial to help us effectively organize and manage the party. This is crucial in winning the 2024 general elections.With your continuous support thus far, I am happy to report that the NPP is the most organized political party in Ghana. In respect of the current state of the NPP as evidence of our level of preparedness for the 2024 general elections, I can say confidently that, building on the hard work started by the previous administration, we continue to be the most vibrant and leading political party in Ghana.Indeed, despite the negative impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic on political activities, we were the first party in Ghana that was able to organize conferences and elected polling station executives in the over 38,000 polling stations in the country; elected constituency executives in all the 275 constituencies; elected regional executives in all the 16 regions of the country and ultimately elected national executive officers.We have equally successfully undertaken a nationwide membership registration, and have also begun rolling out a new biometric membership ID card with the launch of a new biometric membership identification system to issue new party cards to our members and for the management of membership data. We have successfully organized orientation and training workshops for the national and regional party executives to prepare ourselves for the task ahead.We have initiated the “Party-Government Engagements series”, which is an initiative that is aimed at bridging the gap between the party and government by strengthening the relationship between government appointees and party executives at all levels through regular face-to-face interactions. Following the introduction of the initiative, some senior government officials and CEOs of government agencies visited the Party headquarters and held fruitful interactions with party officials.Without a doubt, all these feats, can certainly, only be achieved by a well-organized political party that is well-prepared to go into the 2024 general elections and win by the grace of God.Mr Chairman, having come this far, another crucial activity that is ahead of the Party going into the election of 2024 is the organization of parliamentary and presidential primaries to select our respective candidates. This exercise is so crucial that our victory in 2024 is largely hinged on how we conduct ourselves before, during and after these primaries.On account of this, I wish to make a passionate appeal to all prospective aspirants, their supporters, party members and all stakeholders of the Party to respect the rules of engagement. We should always be guided by the supreme interest of the party and eschew all acts that have the tendency of dividing our ranks. We cannot have an effective and well-organized party to break the eight if we do not prioritize the party’s interest. Our victory in 2024 will largely depend on how we conduct ourselves in the upcoming presidential and parliamentary primaries.It is in view of the importance of these primaries on our electoral fortunes that the National Council of the Party formulated a Code of Conduct to regulate our conduct during the period preceding the opening of nominations for these primaries. It is also worth reminding all party members that the Code of Conduct is still in force, and as national officers, we will continue to monitor its implementation to ensure maximum conformity. This is crucial to help us close our ranks going into the 2024 general elections and to be able to break the eight.As members of the Council of Elders of our Party, you have an important role to play in promoting the Code of Conduct and generally, in ensuring party discipline, which again is absolutely necessary for our victory in 2024. I, therefore, appeal to every member of the party to support us in this endeavour. This is needed for the party to break the eight.Distinguished Elders, I also wish to report to you that the party is currently engaging stakeholders and would very soon come out with a timetable for the conduct of the Party’s parliamentary and presidential primaries. For your information at the last Steering Committee, National Executive Committee and National Council meetings held on 2nd February 2023, it was resolved that due to the importance of this exercise on the party’s electoral fortunes in 2024, there was the need for the party to build consensus among all relevant stakeholders before deciding on timelines for the conduct of the primaries.At the right time when a broader stakeholder consultation is done and this decision is eventually taken, the Party would issue appropriate rules and regulations to govern the conduct of these primaries. I once again plead to all party members to abide by these rules and regulations in the interest of the party. I wish to reiterate the point that as national officers of the Party, not only are we going to be impartial but will also ensure a level playing field for all prospective aspirants in the conduct of both the parliamentary and presidential primaries.We admonish supporters of would-be aspirants and members of the party to refrain from the use of provocative language in the lead-up to the party’s primaries. We should all remember that we remain the sons and daughters of the womb of one giant elephant. This is the only party we have. We should remind ourselves of the very reason for our existence as a political party which finds expression in Article 2(3) of the Party’s Constitution. i.e. “to win political power through democratic means in order to pursue the party’s agenda as provided for in the party’s manifesto for a general election”.LONG LIVE THE NPPLONG LIVE GHANAKUKRUDU!

When the President first cut the sod in 2021, as you may know, he promised the wonderful people of this nation that the project would be finished in 12 to 18 months. He now asserts, \"No, I will complete before I cede power in 2024.\"The Akufo-Addo-led government has secured a US$100 million start-up fund through the Ghana Investment Infrastructure Fund (GIIF) for the commencement of works on the ‘Agenda 111’ district, specialized and regional hospitals across the country.The Agenda 111 project includes 101 district hospitals, six regional hospitals in the newly created regions, two specialized hospitals in the middle and northern belts, as well as a regional hospital in the Western Region and renovation of the Effia-Nkwanta Regional Hospital.The objective of the Project was to significantly deepen the delivery of quality healthcare at the district level, boost access to healthcare services for all citizens towards ensuring the attainment of the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goal Three.',\n",
       " 'One of the leading members of the New Patriotic Party (NPP) who have declared their intentions to run for the flagbearer position of the party, Dr. Kofi Konadu Apraku, has said that if he was the president, Ken Ofori-Atta would have long lost his job by now. According to him, it is enough that there are many disgruntled members of the party, mainly their Members of Parliament, who have expressed their no-confidence in the performance of the Minister of Finance. He added that were he in the shoes of President Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo, what he would have done was to give into their demands and get the finance minister off the job, a report by citinewsroom.com has said. “If I were the president [Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo], I would have listened to the MPs and sacked Ofori-Atta,” he is quoted to have said in an interview with GTV.It will be recalled that there were over 80 MPs on the Majority side of parliament who recently addressed the press, announcing their disaffection with the Minister of Finance. The MPs then called on the president to sack Ken Ofori-Atta or risk having them no longer participate in any government business that would be brought before parliament. Although this is yet to happen, as President Akufo-Addo has severally indicated that he finds nothing wrong with the work of his appointee, Dr. Kofi Konadu Apraku has said that there is the need for the president to examine the sentiments of the MPs and those of the general public. “In politics, you have to be sensitive to public opinion. Sometimes, it may not be the truth, but that is the sentiments, and the sentiments of the people need to be examined, and acted upon if it is possible. It’s a great deal for the NPP MPs to come out there to say they don’t want our finance minister, their own Finance Minister that they have worked with in the past.“In democracy, we have to be sensitive to the people. Lack of action exacerbates the problem, so you cut it off and cut your losses and I would have cut my losses and said please you have done enough, the environment is hostile to you so go. I would have changed him,” he is quoted to have said.The race for the top-spot of the NPP party elections is yet to be officially opened but so far, a number of names have popped up, indicating that they are also interested in the spot. Some of the names that come up have been Alan Kyerematen, the immediate-past Minister of Trade and Industry; Dr Akoto Owusu Afriyie, the former Minister of Food and Agriculture; Francis Addai-Nimoh, a former MP for Ashanti Mampong; and the Vice President, Dr. Mahamudu Bawumia.

       " ' There has been drama in parliament following the reshuffle in Minority leadership by the National Democratic Congress. Following the resumption of parliament on February 7, 2023, the new minority leaders were supposed to take their new seat which is the front bench. The previous leaders were also to be reallocated to their new seats to match their current status.Haruna Iddrisu, former minority leader, was given a seat on the front bench with Cletus Avoka, who is one of the longest-serving MPs and Former Majority leader. The seat was previously occupied by Member of Parliament for Asutifi South, Collins Dauda, who is also a longest-serving MP but was not a leader.Haruna Iddrisu did not occupy that seat even though he showed up in the house on February 7. He left the chamber before the house commenced sitting for the day, with his name tag attached to what used to be Collins Dauda’s seat.Haruna gets another seat: On Thursday, February 9, however, Haruna Iddrisu showed up again in parliament, while the Speaker, Alban Bagbin was leading proceedings. When he walked in, he sat on a different seat, behind his successor; Dr Cassiel Ato Forson. This time, his name had been repositioned on this seat behind the new minority leader; Dr. Ato Forson, from the previous one which was Collins Dauda’s. This seat was also Dr. Ato Forson’s former seat.What happened Just when the Speaker left the chamber for the deputy Speaker, Joseph Osei Owusu to take over the proceedings, Haruna Iddrisu moved from his original seat to Joseph Osei Owusu’s seat to make his contribution to the statement and added that he had rejected Collins Dauda’s seat. In his concluding statement to a motion on the floor of the house, the Tamale South MP apologised to Joseph Osei Owusu for contributing to the statement from his (Joe Wise’) seat, and detailed why he rejected Collins Dauda’s seat. He said the Asutifi South MP is his senior in age and also in terms of his stay in parliament, therefore as a well-trained man, he will not accept the seat. “Mr Speaker, forgive me that I have to assume your chair, there was [sic] whether I should take over from Collins Dauda or yours and I have told them that honourable Collins Dauda is senior by age and a senior even to this house. So, I will not fit into his chair as somebody who is well-trained from home. So, any other chair Mr speaker, is acceptable to me, I am still the elected member of parliament for Tamale South,” he said in the chamber on February 9 after he made a contribution.Contradictions in Haruna’s posturing b> The twist in events raises questions about Haruna Iddrisu’s position on a befitting seat for him following Haruna’s movement from his new seat (Ato Forson’s previous seat) to that of the Deputy Speaker, Joseph Osei Owusu, after the latter assumed the Speaker’s seat, makes it more confusing and raises questions about what exactly the concerns of Haruna Iddrisu are with regards to the issue of his sitting position.Allocation of seats: Commenting on this development, on February 10, the Minority Chief Leader, Governs Agbodza clarified that the new leaders had allocated seats to the former leaders.You can also watch this edition of People & Places on GhanaWeb TV: YNA/WA',\n",

Speaking in a Citi TV interview, on Friday, which was monitored by GhanaWeb, Lawyer Kpebu compared Sophia Akuffo to Yaa Asantewaa, the Queen Mother of Ejisu, who led the Ashanti Empire to war against the British in 1900. “Seeing her there, I was surprised. She has always had that public spirit, but I did not know she could express it in this way, and it is good that she did… she has broken a glass ceiling. “Because we have made it look like once you have certain positions in government or in Ghana generally, then you were barred from coming to certain conversations. But with what she has done, she has broken the glass ceiling.“She has changed the face of our democracy. Because if our former CJ demonstrated, that is super, super, super! God bless her for this. I call her the Yaa Asantewaa returns. We need more people to speak,” he said.Martin Kpebu, a convener of the Individual Bond Holders Association of Ghana, added that the action of the former Chief Justice has strengthened the resolve of individual bondholders in their demand to be excluded from the DDEP.The former Chief Justice of Ghana, Sophia Akuffo, who was appointed by President Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo, joined retirees in picketing the Ministry of Finance in Accra.The pensioners have been picketing at the premises of the ministry since Monday, February 6, 2023, over the government’s plan to include their bonds in its Domestic Debt Exchange programme.Captured in a front-seat position at the premises of the Ministry of Finance, the former Chief Justice has in hand a wooden placard. Her placard read: “We use our bond yields to pay our: rents, medical bills, electricity, water bills.”She described the government\\'s move to include pensioners in the debt exchange programme as wicked, disrespectful, and unlawful and threatened to sue the government if it goes ahead with it.According to her, it is wrong for the government, through the Ministry of Finance, to sacrifice pensioners\\' hard-earned monies to save the government after serving the nation.While bemoaning the negative impact of the debt exchange programme on pensioners in an interview with GhanaWeb Business, Sophia Akuffo stressed that it was heartbreaking to see her age mates and others older than her go through pain.\"It is very heart-breaking to see people, particularly in my age group, some are older than me, some are somewhat younger than me, but these are all people who have worked very hard. They could have left the country when others were going. They stayed, they worked for the nation.\"I find this wicked, disrespectful, I find it unlawful.

       " 'The New Patriotic Party (NPP) in the Krowor Constituency, has inaugurated their woman wings to work towards ensuring the party\\'s win in the 2024 general elections. The theme for the inauguration was, \"Empowering the women, building the nation to break the 8\".In an interview, the Women Organizer for NPP Krowor Constituency, Madam Naa Adole Wutah-Ofei pointed out that, whereas some people believe that the women’s organiser position is the only active role in the female front of the party, every role within the wing is essential to its objective.According to her, while women are naturally meant to be help mates to men, it has become more necessary in the current era for women to take up active roles in the development of society.She noted that the current NPP government has shown commitment towards women empowerment. This she said is being done through various avenues such as the Microfinance and Small Loans Centre.\"I feel happy when a woman is empowered because, the house becomes very happy,\"  she said.On the issuance of loans through MASLOC for women to start up and grow their businesses, Madam Wutah-Ofei said the government further finds it necessary to ensure that women are given skills further to the funding.\"If you don\\'t give them skills training, at the end of the day when the money comes in, you will find them using it for wrong purposes, buying funeral clothes and other things. But when you train them and empowered them, that is when they use the money wisely \" she added.Madam Adole disclosed that through her own effort, she has been able to train some women in mushrooms and snail farming and has also trained 17 women to acquire makeup skills.On the issue of disunity among the NPP Krowor Constituency, Naa Adole Wutah-Ofei said it is never true as being speculated by the NDC and added that, where there are humans, disagreement is bound to sets in and that, the NDC is also facing same.\"One thing I have realized in our party is that, normally when we are in power, the division is much\".She pointed out the variance in development experienced during the leadership of the former NPP member of parliament for the area, Elizabeth Afoley Quaye as compared to the current MP who is from the opposition NDC.On the issue of current hardship in the country, Naa Adole said it is everywhere in the world. \"As you progress, life becomes harder. You will never get something like an easy life. There is no easy life anywhere\".She therefore, called on the youth not to always depend on white-collar jobs as the only opportunity available but to use available opportunities and acquire skills as well as engage in other works that will earn them a living. The NPP Chairman for Krowor Constituency, Mr. Joseph Attah Gyema on his part said, the aim of the inauguration is to enable the women work towards breaking of the \"8\" in the coming general elections.He advised the women\\'s wing to work hard for the party to win the seat back in the Krowor Constituency saying, they would support any NPP member who would come to contest as a Parliamentary candidate that the delegates would elect.Mr. Attah Gyema therefore, called for unity and hard work towards victory 2024 for the NPP party.',\n",

This guy will probably be under 40 years but President Akufo-Addo made comments which can collapse the country at the age of 68 years. There was nobody or a statement issued by NPP which had even a sentence condemning it,” he said.“Akufo-Addo is my grandfather, I don’t have the knowledge he has but at the age of 68 years, he said \"all die be die.\" NPP members glorified him and even made him their leader,” the Western Regional Communications Officer of the NDC added.The Ghana Police Service on Wednesday, February 8, 2023, announced the arrest of Razak Avoliya the Youth Organiser for the NDC in the Suame Constituency of the Ashanti Region following investigation into a viral video in which he incited political violence ahead of the 2024 general elections.The police had early announced a search for the youth organiser following the publication of a video in which he was heard inciting violence.Speaking to a journalist on the sidelines on what looked like a party event, the man charged members of the NDC not to hesitate to shed blood if it is what it will take to win power.“As journalists, you were witnesses to a situation where people were shot and killed in the 2020 elections. So standing here today, I am to make sure that no NPP member can come and kill me. So we are in and I will advise every true NDC member that in the 2024 elections when it becomes necessary to kill someone to win, kill them; even if it requires that you shoot someone or club them to win us power do it,” he told a journalist with Oyerepa FM.Subsequently, he has been remanded into custody by the Asokwa District Court after he was charged by the police for offensive conduct conducive to breaches of peace of the state.He is scheduled to reappear in court on February 14, 2023.GA/SARA',\n",

Because there are statutory funds one is tempted to believe that because the President has the mandate to appoint an Administrator for the GETFund, and then appoint an Administrator for the Common Fund, there’s that temptation that can I appoint an Administrator for the Road Fund. But the Road Fund governance structure places the Road Fund Secretariat under the Chief Director of the Ministry of Rods and Highways.The former Senior Manager of the Ministry of Roads and Highways said this is a problem for him“What will be my quo warranto, because they are all Civil Servants who are working there, but I’m not a Civil Servant.

If they discussed issues in order for you people to gain power, why do you have to suffer now that you are in charge? He fired on Peace FM\\'s Kokrokoo show hosted by Kwami Sefa Kayi.According to Mr. Charles Owusu, instead of depending on its \"failed appointees,\" who are unable to effectively connect with the populace, the NPP government should have relied on the media experts in this nation to convey the \"correct messages\" in the Auditor General\\'s report and the Debt Exchange Programme to the general public.\"I\\'ve seen a video of appointees holding a press conference at the party\\'s headquarters to explain the Auditor General\\'s report and the Debt Exchange Programme, when journalists would make sure the right information goes out, meanwhile that job is been done by the very appointees who have failed Akufo-Addo,\" he stated.He added that after this administration\\'s treatment of journalists with disappointment, majority of them are carrying grudges and would undoubtedly punish the party for it in the upcoming elections.This government, according to Rev. Charles Owusu, has performed admirably well, and therefore urged the NPP leadership to begin dealing with a new crop of communicators and journalists who can sell the government\\'s achievements to the populace, instead of depending on the \"same group\" which the President has surrounded himself with.\"Will the NPP continue to decline despite Nana Akufo-Addo\\'s success and popularity with the populace?

       " 'The National Democratic Congress (NDC) has raised serious concerns about a letter Attorney General, Godfred Yeboah Dame sent to the Auditor General about publishing a COVID-19 expenditure of the government.The AG said the Auditor General breached the constitution by releasing the document to the public domain prior to its interrogation by the Public Accounts Committee.In a letter to the Auditor-General, Johnson Akuamoah-Asiedu, the Attorney General said Article 187(5) of the Constitution mandates the Auditor-General to submit his report to Parliament and in that report, draw attention to any irregularities in the accounts audited.He added that Article 187(6) of the Constitution requires that Parliament must then debate the report of the Auditor-General and appoint, where necessary and in the public interest, a committee.Godfred Dame believes only after satisfying the constitutional requirement of submitting the Auditor General’s report to Parliament, the subsequent debate by Parliament thereon and the conclusion of work by the appropriate committee of Parliament, that the report of the Auditor-General may be considered final and relevant action may be taken thereon.But the NDC has condemned the action of Godfred Dame in no uncertain terms, saying it is an “ungodly interference and intrusion into the mandate of the Auditor-General by someone who ought to know better.”A statement signed by Sammy Gyamfi, the NDC National Communication Officer said, “We need not remind the Attorney-General that Article 187(7)(a) of the 1992 Constitution guarantees the independence of the Auditor-General. It explicitly provides that, the Auditor-General in the performance of his duties, is not subject to the direction or control of any person or authority.”Below is the statement from NDC.STATEMENTFor Immediate Release:10th February 2023WITHDRAW YOUR UNCONSTITUTIONAL LETTER TO THE AUDITOR-GENERAL – NDC TO ATTORNEY GENERAL, GODFRED DAME.The National Democratic Congress (NDC) has become aware of a letter addressed to the Auditor-General, by the Attorney-General, Godfred Yeboah Dame in which he condemned the latter over his publication of the report on the Special Audit of COVID-19 expenditures of the Government of Ghana for the period March 2020 to June 2022.The Attorney-General in the said letter, among other concerns, took umbrage to the publication of the said audit report which he describes as “premature” because, in his view, the same has not been debated by Parliament and considered by the appropriate committee of Parliament.The NDC condemns in no uncertain terms this ungodly interference and intrusion into the mandate of the Auditor-General by someone who ought to know better. We need not remind the Attorney-General that Article 187(7)(a) of the 1992 Constitution guarantees the independence of the Auditor-General. It explicitly provides that, the Auditor-General in the performance of his duties, is not subject to the direction or control of any person or authority.We can appreciate the discomfiture of Godfred Dame, given that as the principal legal advisor to the corrupt Akufo-Addo/Bawumia Government, he is obviously worried by the putrefying rot that has been uncovered by the Auditor-General regarding how COVID-19 funds were grossly misused by functionaries of the government. However, we cannot help the fears of the Attorney-General who has to be reminded in very clear terms that, the Auditor-General’s fidelity is to the laws of this country and not him.The Audit Service Act, 2000 (Act 584) confers power and responsibility on the Auditor-General to carry out special audits, as has been conducted into the COVID-19 expenditures of the Akufo-Addo/Bawumia government. For the purpose of clarity, section 16 of Act 584 provides that:“The Auditor-General may in addition to the audit of public accounts, carry out in the public interest any necessary special audits or reviews and shall submit reports on the audits or review so undertaken to Parliament”.It is worthy of note that, Section 23 of the Audit Service Act, 2000 (ACT 584) mandates the Auditor-General to publish reports of audits as soon as the reports have been presented to the Speaker of Parliament.Therefore, contrary to the claims of the Attorney General, the publication of the Auditor General’s special Audit report on the COVID-19 expenditures of the Akufo-Addo/Bawumia government was in strict conformity with the law. As a matter of fact, the Auditor General was duty-bound to publish the said report, which is precisely what he has done.Godfred Dame must understand, that the Auditor-General in the performance of his duties is not subject to his legal opinions or interpretation of the law. His contention that the Auditor General has to wait for Parliament to enquire or debate audit reports he submits to the house before the same is published is totally baseless and not borne out of the Constitution or any law in force in Ghana.It must be emphasized that the age-long practice of publication of audit reports by the Auditor General is a legal imperative and conforms with the principles of probity, transparency and accountability that underpin the 1992 Constitution. Indeed, it is through such publications that the good people of Ghana, in whom sovereignty resides, are able to appreciate discussions and debates on audit reports by their representatives in Parliament.The Auditor General deserves commendation for faithfully discharging his duties and not condemnation. Only a corrupt government that has a penchant for whitewashing acts of thievery will be worried about the publication of Audit Reports.We in the NDC are particularly worried by this latest brazen attack on the independence of the Auditor-General given the unlawful manner in which the former Auditor-General, Daniel Yao Domelovo was hounded out of office for exposing similar corrupt activities of the Akufo-Addo/Bawumia government.We demand that the Attorney-General, Godfred Yeboah Dame immediately withdraws his unconstitutional and distasteful letter forthwith and cease any further intrusion into the mandate of the Auditor-General. And we call on the Auditor-General to totally disregard the said letter of the Attorney General and treat it with utmost contempt as same is unconstitutional.We also call on Civil Society Organizations, the media, moral society and all well-meaning Ghanaians to rise up and condemn this assault on the independence of the Auditor-General by the Attorney General.Signed.SAMMY GYAMFI ESQ.(National Communication Officer)',\n",

Sophia Akuffo said this when she joined pensioners who are picketing at the finance minister\\'s office against his decision to include the investment of pensioners in the government’s Domestic Debt Exchange Programme. The pensioners have vehemently rejected the move, stating that they do not want their monies included in the programme because they survive on the returns on such investments.The former Chief Justice, who clarified that she was not affected by DDEP, said she was there in solidarity with her fellow retirees. She stressed that these retirees have served the nation well and do not deserve the treatment they are being given. \"These are all people who have worked. They have worked very hard.

Ghana is seeking an IMF bailout of $3 billion, but the Fund wants to be sure that the government’s debts are sustainable, hence the voluntary Domestic Debt Exchange Programme to deal with its domestic debts. It has also come up with some measures, including the country joining the Paris Club to deal with its international debts - to have the foreign debts delayed or forgiven.With the DDEP, the government is seeking to restructure approximately GH¢137.3 billion of the domestic debts it accrued through bonds it issued, including the E.S.L.A. Plc and Daakye Trust Plc, and per the requirement of the IMF, 80 percent of the country’s total debts must be subject to this debt exchange programme. AE/WA',\n",
       " 'Kwabena Agyei Agyepong, a Flagbearer hopeful of the ruling New Patriotic Party (NPP), has rounded off his campaign tour of the Western and Central Regions, stressing the need for the Party to chart a new course by choosing him, a new face to lead it into victory in 2024.He said the Party’s chances of winning the 2024 General Election will be greatly enhanced with him as the Flagbearer with his “New Dawn” message to revive the country’s democracy.Kwabena Agyepong, also known as KAA, said this in a news brief to the Ghana News Agency (GNA), Accra, detailing that his vision of a new paradigm on Ghana’s political landscape was resonating positively with Party executives and activists.The message is focused on the vision for a “New Dawn”, the transformation of the political system, and to revive the faith that Ghanaians have in the country’s democracy to “secure the future of our party and the country”.“As someone who has served Prof Adu Boahen in 1992, Candidate Akufo-Addo in 1998 and President JA Kufuor in various campaigns over the years, I can confidently say that the executives of these two regions have wholeheartedly accepted my message,” the news brief said.“I have no doubt in my mind that these faithful executives will cast their votes and give their mandates to KAA to lead the Party to the historic third consecutive victory for the Party in the upcoming 2024 General Election.”The brief said the Party faithful were deeply appreciative of KAA’s longstanding commitment and dedicated service to the NPP having availed himself to the Party in the heady days of adversity and that he had established a strong bond between himself and the Party grassroots.“I have no doubt in my mind that, these faithful executives will cast their votes and give their mandate to KAA to lead the great Elephant Party,” it added.You can also watch this edition of People & Places on GhanaWeb TV:',\n",
       " 'Kwabena Agyei Agyepong, a flagbearer hopeful of the New Patriotic Party (NPP), has described his indefinite suspension as the General Secretary of NPP in 2015 as ‘unconstitutional’ and ‘needless’. The former General Secretary of the NPP labelled the party’s decision as an aberration that was politically arranged by some faceless people who could not stand his outstanding leadership but went all out to tarnish his reputation. He regretted the apparent silence of many party big shots on his undeserved suspension, saying “the NPP has many legal luminaries and eminent personalities who could have saved the situation, but I was left to my fate regardless of my opinion on the matter. “What happened to me is an aberration that should never be meted out to anyone in any political party because it was unconstitutional and needless.” Kwabena Agyepong disclosed this in an interview with the media in Cape Coast on Wednesday. Kwabena Agyepong, together with Paul Afoko, a former National Chairman of the, and Sammy Crabbe, a former Vice Chairman, was suspended indefinitely by the party in 2015. He could not comprehend why the party that prided itself as the apostle of democracy and rule of law in Ghana, unexpectedly unheeded its constitutional dictates. Irrespective of the vile propaganda and misinformation, Mr. Agyepong said he contributed immensely to the party’s electoral victory in 2016 and 2020. “Despite the baseless accusations that I was working against the Presidential ambition of President Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo, I mobilised resources from friends and well-wishers to support the party. “I supported the party in the Upper East and West, Brong Ahafo, Ashanti, and 20 constituencies in the Northern Region and submitted a receipt of my contributions to the party,” Mr. Agyepong revealed. He bemoaned the side-lining sub-culture of character assassination and scandalous allegations about political opponents or individuals who may have divergent views. He admonished politicians and political parties to be measured in their utterances and eschew politics of insults to avoid tension in the country. Rather, all politicians must conduct their campaigns in peace, and harmony and communicate their messages without insults.  That political dilemma, Mr. Agyepong said, had geared him on to declare a new dawn, a new dimension, and a new direction for NPP and Ghana. To him, Ghana needed a new direction and capable leadership that genuinely puts people before politics and inspired hope for a better future. For that matter, he resolved to lead a passionate redemption mission to create a shift in the thinking and orientation of what public service and party politics should be.You can also watch this edition of People & Places on GhanaWeb TV:',\n",

Let us all give the maximum support and rally around the new leaders to deliver as we did for our previous leaders,” Prof. Asiedu admonished.

Speaking to the Sefwi Wiawso Traditional Council, during his recent campaign tour, Alan said that although the Akufo-Addo government has achieved some milestones, the current messed-up economy is dwarfing that success to the extent that the party cannot even come up with a credible message to sell to the electorate.Mr Kyerematen pointed out, for instance, that the Akufo-Addo government introduced the Free SHS; Planting for Food and Jobs; One District, One Factory and a lot more programmes but contrasted: “As we are all aware, the economy is currently not doing well; things are not well at all”.Reacting to this in an interview on Adom FM interview monitored by GhanaWeb, Boakye Danquah said that the comments made by Alan are unfortunate and an indictment of the tremendous achievement of the Nana Akufo-Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo government.He added that Alan, a former minister of trade and industry, should keep mute if he has no message for the people of Ghana.Watch the interview below:You can also watch this edition of People & Places on GhanaWeb TV:  IB/BOG\",\n",

       " 'A National Democratic Congress (NDC) activists in the Northern Region have dismissed claims that former Minority Leader, Haruna Iddrisu, along with former Minority Chief Whip, Mohammed Muntaka Mubarak and other former leaders in the Minority front are at loggerheads with Speaker of Parliament, Rt. Hon. Alban Sumana Kingsford Bagbin.Reacting to claims that the former Minority leaders are blaming the Speaker for instigating their removal from office, the Northerners said the claim is a bad joke that was concocted by the New Patriotic Party (NPP) in attempt to bang the heads of the Speaker and the former leaders together.“But this bad joke by the NPP has already failed because as we speak, the Speaker and Hon. Haruna Iddrissu remain very good friends and Akatamansonian comrades,” the activists said in a statement.They added that, “the Speaker also remains very cordial with former Minority Chief Whip, Mohammed Muntaka Mubarak and the other members of the former Minority leadership in Parliament.”Mohammed Alhassan had signed the statement on behalf of a group of activists of the NDC in the Northern Region who have been responding to tribal, and ethnocentrically tinged subtle campaign by the NPP aimed at instigating bad blood between the Speaker and Mr. Haruna Iddrisu in particular.The NPP’s poisonous campaign had started in the form of fake news articles by tabloids affiliated to the party which claimed that the recent reshuffle of the Minority’s leadership in Parliament was instigated by the Speaker.According to the articles, Rt. Hon. Alban Bagbin had caused Haruna Iddrisu and Muntaka Mubarak respectively, to be removed as Minority Leader and Minority Chief Whip because they were uncooperative with the Speaker.Already, some women’s group of the NDC in the Eastern region have                                pooh-poohed the reports as lacking foundation in commonsense because the reshuffle was neither announced nor implemented by the Speaker, but by the party’s national leadership.“Anybody who is claiming that the Speaker caused the removal of Haruna Iddrisu as Minority Leader is obviously floundering in rascality because the evidence shows that the Speaker remains beholden to the Minority Leader and the Minority Chief Whip.Was it not the Minority, led by Haruna Iddrisu which fought for Bagbin to become Speaker, even when the NPP’s Carlos Ahenkorah stole ballot papers and chewed them like a goat in attempt to stop Bagbin’s election? We all remember it was Hon. Muntaka who actually slapped Carlos Ahenkorah over the attempt. What would then make the Speaker want to remove them?” Mohammed Alhassan asked.Meanwhile, another women’s group in the Northern region has reiterated the position of the NDC women’s group in Osino, Eastern Region, that the claim that Bagbin instigated the reshuffle lacks foundation in commonsense.In a statement signed by Hajia Azubia Maiga, the claim was pooh-poohed as, “desperado moves by a failed government of the NPP.”The statement said the stories are “an appalling campaign of yellow journalism by NPP tabloids whose government has become a laughing stock because of its monumental failure and slapstick quality of its governance.”It said there is no blood between the Rt. Hon. Bagbin and Hon. Haruna Iddrisu and that, “this reshuffle by the party’s leadership is acceptable to all of us.”Meanwhile, the statement urged the NDC’s leadership not to lose focus but ignore the NPP and March on to victory in 2024 with Dr. Kwabena Duffuor, an economist who cannot be manipulated by the NPP to annoy Ghanaians with a dead\\xa0goat\\xa0comment.',\n",

However, in the short term, Ghanaians who are in employment can be assisted with loans to rent accommodation and the money advanced to them deducted over a long spread. This way government does not lose money while Ghanaians are not left to suffer over accommodation.“I bet you this kind of thinking can never happen in the NDC; it just shows you that the NPP is intellectually and mentally superior to the NDC which has similarly been in power for four terms just like us but could do next to nothing about the accommodation problems,” Nene Ofoe-Teye said.The NRAS is a financial support scheme to cushion Ghanaians in respect of their rent needs. It was launched in Accra recently.The intervention is expected to provide low-interest loans for qualified applicants to enable them to pay their rent in advance.Vice-President, Dr Mahamudu Bawumia, who launched the scheme in Accra explained that the government had set aside GH¢30 million as seed money towards the implementation of the scheme.The scheme would be rolled out initially in the Greater Accra, Ashanti, Western, Eastern, Northern and Bono East regions.“if we are counting, this will be the umpteenth social intervention that an NPP government has rolled out in Ghana while the NDC has next to none to point to as social interventions,” Nene Ofoe-Teye said.According to him, “this makes it a fraud for the NDC to describe itself as a socialist party.“All over the world, socialist parties roll out socialist interventions; it’s only in the case of the NDC that it is not rolling out anything.”In addition to the NRAS, governments of the NPP have implemented the National Health Insurance Scheme, Livelihood Empowerment against Poverty and Free Senior High School\\xa0among\\xa0others.',\n",

If our finance minister and Bawumia, the head of the Economic Management Team, have been useful in the job that we pay them to do, we wouldn’t need a debt exchange program,\"  the Ningo Prampram MP said.But the description of Bawumia’s management of the economy as useless did not sit well with Davis Ansah Opoku.The Mpraeso MP told Sam George to show Vice President Bawumia some respect.“Show some little respect; you are talking about the vice president.

Below is the statement in its entirety:We have taken notice of a video in circulation on social media in which the NDC Youth Organizer for Suame is heard making some statements that bother on possible reprisals to state-sponsored violence during elections.We note that the young man misspoke, as the message he sought to convey did not come out as intended. It is an indisputable fact that state-sponsored violence and thuggery have been the modus operandi of the Akufo-Addo/Bawumia/NPP government.The Akufo-Addo/Bawumia government has benefitted and continues to profit from violence as we witnessed in the Ayawaso West Wuogon By-election, the 2020 Voter Registration Exercise and the 2020 General Election during which eight (8) innocent Ghanaians were murdered by state-sponsored bandits belonging to the ruling NPP.It is hypocritical that the Ghana Police Service which failed to even comment on or take action against the NPP bandits who perpetrated these heinous crimes against innocent Ghanaians, most of whom are NDC members, will turn around to swiftly call for the arrest of a young man for misspeaking.Again, it is the height of hypocrisy to hear people in the Akufo-Addo/Bawumia government and the New Patriotic Party pretend to condemn the statement of this constituency youth leader, when not too long ago, NPP Presidential Candidate, Nana Akufo-Addo and other NPP national leaders threatened fire and brimstone at a time when this nation had not experienced anything close to the barbarity seen during the Ayawaso West Wuogon and 2020 general elections. We have not forgotten about the infamous \"All die be die\" mantra of the current President, nor have we forgotten about Kennedy Agyapong\\'s call for the murder of people of certain ethnic extraction in Ghana; a comment that was celebrated by the NPP. Sammi Awuku\\'s call for NPP supporters to inflict pain and injury on their opponents with pestles is still fresh on our minds, and so is Anthony Karbo\\'s call for Afghanistan to be visited on Ghana. We have also not forgotten about Wontumi\\'s call for an Arab Spring-styled violence in Ghana.Whilst we do not subscribe to violence as a party, except in cases of self-defence, we cannot overlook the genuine sentiment and frustration of people who feel helpless in the face of incessant and unprovoked attacks and killings under this Akufo-Addo/Bawumia government. In the circumstances, we reiterate that the young man misspoke and must be pardoned.The Ghana Police Service must stop harassing this innocent NDC activist, who clearly spoke out of the pain he and other NDC supporters have suffered at the hands of NPP thugs in the Ashanti Region over the years and rather, focus on arresting NPP bandits and terrorists who have attacked a Court of competent jurisdiction in Kumasi and have maimed and killed several innocent Ghanaians.We urge the millions of our young supporters to continue to exercise restraint and not allow the fact that President Akufo-Addo rode to power on the back of so much bloodshed and barbarity to make them want to mimic Nana Akufo-Addo and his very violent political party.

If you’re going to do something that is fake to influence the Ghanaian political process then do something that is reasonable … what has been done takes us for granted,” he said.He added that the vice president associating himself with the polls affects his credibility.Also, the former NPP communication director said that the party needs a flagbearer who is credible and can be trusted by the people of Ghana.Alan Kyerematen, a former minister of trade and industry, is expected to face stiff competition from Vice President Dr. Mahamudu Bawumia, former Food and Agriculture Minister, Dr Owusu Afriyie Akoto and the Member of Parliament for Assin Central, Kennedy Agyapong,  for the flagbearership position of the NPP.The poll by Outcomes International Ghana and the Centre for Sustainable African Development Initiatives (C-SADI) UK, projected that the vice president will win the presidential primaries in almost all the regions in the country.According to the survey, the most popular candidate for the New Patriotic Party flagbearer position in all 16 regions of Ghana is the vice president.In all, the survey got responses from around 197,000 NPP polling station executives (PSEs) in all the regions.“Data was obtained mainly through computer-assisted personal interviewing (CAPI) technology between 15th November 2022 and 15th December 2022. Based on 95% confidence level and 2% margin of error a sample size of 6000 PSEs was used. However, 5641 PSEs were successfully interviewed (response rate of 94%) from all 96 constituencies.“Greater Accra region had the highest number of PSEs interviewed with 1142 PSEs followed by the Ashanti region with 869 PSEs corresponding to 20.2% and 15.4% respectively. More than half of PSE’s who participated in the survey were Akan (54% [n=3056 PSEs]), and 46% (n=2585 PSEs) were non-Akan. In terms of religious distribution, 78% of the PSEs were Christian whilst 20.6% were Muslim,” the report stated.Watch the interview in the video below:IB/WA\",\n",

       " 'The Senior Staff Association of the Electoral Commission is beside itself with sorrow over a myriad of issues militating against its work, including the body\\'s failure to pay service providers for the 2020 general elections.The association also talked about delayed payments of administrative releases, outstanding bills for logistics, and the drastic reduction of resources for operational activities.In a letter to the Chairperson of the Electoral Commission on February 2, the Association said it was compelled to hold a meeting on January 26 after receiving \"numerous distress calls and messages\" from members, especially regional directors, deputy regional directors, and district electoral officers, on the issues raised.The letter, signed by over 20 executive members from across the country, categorizes their concerns into six categories:1. Delay in the payment of Administrative Releases for the last two quarters of 2022.2. Unprecedented delay in the payment for logistics and other services (canopies, tables, chairs, generators and boat) hired for the 2020 Voter Registration exercise.3. Delay in the payment of allowances for Commissioners for Oaths engaged for the 2020 Voter Transfer Exercise.4. Drastic reduction in the allocation of resources for operational activities of the Commission since the 2018 Referendum to date.5. Constant Pre-financing of operational and administrative activities of the Commission6. Outstanding payments for some temporary Officials engaged for DLE 2019 and 2020 Presidential and Parliamentary Elections.The letter was copied to the Chief of Staff at the Office of the President, Speaker of Parliament, Minister of National Security, General Secretary P.S.W.0 of TUC, and Chairman, Divisional Union of PSWU, EC.Expatiating on the administrative lapses, the Association said due to the inability of EC to make payments for utility bills like water and electricity, some offices of the Commission have been disconnected.Aside from officials being pestered by vendors, some District Electoral Officers have been sued by vendors in attempts to retrieve their monies.It feared if care is not taken, District Electoral Officers would not be able to engage the services of vendors for subsequent exercise.It, therefore, warned that if the Commission fails to settle all outstanding administrative releases in full by the 15th of February, 2023, it will employ legitimate and permissible tools to get their demand met.Find excerpts of their letter below:A. DELAY IN PAYMENT OF ADMINISTRATIVE RELEASES FOR TWO QUARTERS FOR THE YEAR 2022 (SIX MONTHS)i. Delay in the administrative releases for fuel, accountable imprest and inability to service and maintain official vehicles.ii. Payment of unrealistic rates of fuel for official vehiclesiii. Current economic conditions make it impossible for Regional Directors, Deputy Regional Directors and District Electoral Officers to Pre-finance fuel for official vehicles and undertake routine servicing and maintenanceiv. Inability to make payments for utilities (water and electricity) for the Officesv. Disconnection of some offices of the Commission due to non-payment of utility billsB. DELAY IN THE PAYMENT OF OUTSTANDING BILLSi. Non-payments for logistics (canopies, tables, chairs, boats, generators, etc.) used for the 2020 voter registration exercise, undertaken during the peak of the COVID-19 pandemicii. Logistics needed for the exercise were hired, based on quotas, rates and operational, instructions from the Commission, amidst ‘strong warnings’ of sanctions for the failure to adhereiii. Payment of only 20% of the total amount submitted for logistics, almost three (3) years after the exercise, which ended successfully for officers to receive commendations from the Commission for a good job done —the registers used for the 2020 elections are in debtiv. District Electoral Officers are pestered on daily bases with incessant calls from vendors to redeem their debtsv. Some Vendors have sued some District Electoral Officers in the law courts and CHRA. I in attempts to retrieve their monies because Commission is unable to fulfill financial obligationsvi. District Electoral Officers are being verbally abused and even threatened on daily bases for non-payment of bills, making them live in fearvii. \\xa0District Electoral Officers have lost all the respect, dignity, goodwill and some favour that earlier existed in their districts because the Commission has been unable to honour its part of the agreement.viii. District Electoral Officers are now having issues with their families and friends from whom they borrowed to offset some of the bills due to frustration.ix. District Electoral Officers believe that the Commission thinks the vendors were not truly engaged, hence the commission\\'s refusal to pay them.C. DELAY IN PAYMENT OF COMMISSIONERS FOR OATHS ENGAGED FOR THE 2020 TRANSFER OF VOTERSi. District Electoral Officers were instructed through their Regional Directors to engage the services of Commissioners for Oaths during transfer of voters in the year 2020, and have not been paid allowances after the whole exerciseii. The Commissioners for Oaths keep harassing District Electoral Officers because theyhaven’t received their allowance yet.D. DRASTIC REDUCTION IN THE RESOURCES ALLOCATED FOR OPERATIONAL ACTIVITIES BY THE COMMISSIONii. \\xa0Fuel for recruitment of officials, organisation of grassroots, training of officials, collection, distribution and retrieval of electoral materials from the regional offices to the district offices to the field has been reduced drastically since 2018iii. Daily subsistence allowances (D5A) for staff has also seen a reduction per the number of days stipulated for various electoral activities.iv. Resources for hiring of training venue for Training of Trainers (TOT) and grassroots training has been reduced drastically, making the organisation of the training programmes extremely difficult.E. After the payment of officials for the 2019 District Level Elections (DLE) and the 2020 Presidential and Parliamentary Elections, some officials did not receive their allowances due to errors in their bank account details. The leadership of the SSA has made several appeals to Management to see to it that these officials are paid their allowances. However, it appears that the situation has not seen any change.We wish to make a final appeal to Management to address this issue timely so that we can continue to enjoy the support, loyalty and cooperation of our temporary officials during future exercises.In view of the above, the National Council, the second highest decision-making body of the SSA and the mouthpiece for Senior Staff Members at the various regions has resolved to the following:1. Commissions\\' Inability to settle all outstanding administrative releases in full by the 15th of February 2023 will cause the following:a. Hanging of red flags at all offices of the Commission from 16th February 2023 to show our protest.b. Officers would be unable to perform administrative and operational functions that require any financial commitments.c. The National Council of the Association may employ other legitimate and permissible tools under the Labour Laws of Ghana to press on home our demands after hanging of the red flags.2. All arrears owned to vendors should be paid by Wednesday 1st March 2023, to enable District Electoral Officers have the peace of mind to live and work in their districts. In the event that the commission fails to make payments,a. All calls from vendors will be directed to the Commission.b. Vendors will be directed to the Head Office to claim their moniesc. District Electoral Officers would be unable to engage the services of vendors for subsequent exercise3. Resources for operational and administrative activities should be restored to their previous levels; rates and levels should be determined and communicated to officers before the commencement of upcoming activities.4. Officers of the Commission would NOT pre-finance any activities under any circumstance.5. Management should liaise with the Government as a matter of urgency to implement the recommendations made on conditions of service of the staff of the Electoral Commission by the Twenty (20)- member fact finding Parliamentary Adhoc Committee set up by Parliament on Friday,28th January 2011.6. Management should also endeavour to address all these pertinent issues in a timely manner for industrial peace and harmony to prevail, considering the fact that this year is an Election year.Thank you.',\n",
       " 'Some key members and former polling station executives of the governing New Patriotic Party (NPP) in the Asante Akim Central constituency of the Ashanti Region have accused their immediate-past Constituency executives of having manipulated the polling station elections and compiled a fictitious album that serves their interests to the detriment of the party in the Constituency.The aggrieved members, who say they have exhausted laid down processes within the party for seeking redress, are promising to take things into their own hands if fresh polling station elections are not held to rid the party register of fictitious names.At a press conference held Sunday February 5, 2023, to express their grievances, the members, mainly former polling station executives, lamented the dwindling fortunes in the Constituency arising from the manipulation of former leaders of the party in the Constituency.“Members of the press, on 20th February 2022, we invited you to the first press conference on this same subject to register our displeasure on how the Committee tasked to organize the Polling Station elections and the erstwhile Constituency Executive Committee manipulated and contrived the laid down rules set out by the NPP’s constitution to their advantage by conjuring a fictitious delegates’ album.This act was not only a defilement of the constitution and traditions our party is known for among the Centre right all over the world, but also an insult to the loyal members of our Party, the discerning people of Asante Akyem Central who queued at the constituency party office at dawn to follow due process of picking forms to contest as polling station executives.“We cannot continue to inhale from this miasmic environment of total disregard for party principles. We are therefore giving a period of two weeks to see and feel the response of our National Executives. If not, as mentioned earlier, we are justified by all standards to advise ourselves according as we all work hand in hand to break the 8,” they concluded.',\n",
       " 'Eastern Regional campaign coordinator for Alan Kyeremanteng, an aspiring Presidential flag bearer of the New Patriotic Party(NPP), has said that the party needs a christian to lead them into the 2024 elections.Samuel Ayeh-Paye made this statement during a tour by the aspirant in the Ashanti Region last week.One of the many people who have said the comment is in bad taste is Odeneho Kwaku Appiah, a former Chairman of the NPP in the Ashanti Region.In a quick rebuttal he said,“Christianity, traditional and Islam are the three major religions in Ghana. For that reason, the 1992 constitution guarantees religious tolerance and freedom. Today, there are inter-religious marriages all across the country.Hon Haruna ldrissu (MP), Sule Muntari (footballer), Kalsoume Sinare( actress) and others are all muslims married to christians. And by religious tolerance, we appreciate spiritual values, beliefs and practices which are different from ours.It was a great move when the National Chief Imam visited a church and also made a donation to support the building of the national cathedral. His visit and donation to the Cathedral didn’t change his beliefs and principles. This is a sign of religious tolerance which we all need to learn.”When l hear people talk about who to lead and involve beliefs, tribe, faith and the likes, l get worried because the above cannot put food on our table or money in our pocket. Those who have nothing to offer will always want to divide us with the above but let’s say no to intolerance. Religion should not be a reason to reject or accept someone.I strongly believe that NPP members and the people of this country want us to elect someone who will lead and govern this country to our satisfaction. Are we looking for a pastor, lmam or a traditional leader?I ask, when a christian is selected will all our problems be resolved?A research done by CCD afrobarometer shows that more than 9 out of 10 Ghanaians will not mind having people of different faith as neighbors. We are not interested in any tribal politics so let us respect each other’s faith. This religion’s fantasy and fanaticism shouldn’t even be tolerated.COKA called on Mr Ayeh-Paye to immediately apologize as such comments have the tendencies of inflaming the passion of the religious groups and destabilizing the country.“Whoever made that public statement, calling for a christian to lead as president, should as a matter of respect to all religious bodies in the country, not only Islam, apologize. Such useless comments must not be entertained as they have the tendency to cause enmity among the religious groups in the country. to say the least!.”',\n",
       " \"1. IntroductionOn Saturday, 17 December 2022, the National Democratic Congress (NDC) held its National Delegates Conference at the Accra Sports Stadium. The hugely anticipated event had about 9,000 delegates taking turns to cast their votes for their preferred candidate for various positions within the party. This survey was conducted during the period of the conference to gauge the pulse of the grassroots on key important issues. To ensure that the sample size was achieved, data was collected just before the start of the conference and continued till the next morning when the conference ended. The 5 – minutes survey had only 5 questions that sought the opinion of the grassroots on just three issues – the flagbearer, the running mate, and the ability of the national leadership to shepherd the party to victory in the 2024 elections. The survey had only five (5) questions which included the region being represented by the delegate, their constituency, and their views on the three issues, stating their reasons for their preference. A sample of 3,147, weighted based on the regional distribution of the Ghanaian population in the 2021 Population and Housing Census, and with a margin of error of 1.75%, was achieved by the end of the conference, and this included open-ended responses, which were analysed and organized into several thematic areas.2. FindingsRegional Distribution of Delegates*Weighted based on the regional distribution in the 2021 Population and Housing CensusThe above table depicts the regional distribution of delegates that were interviewed in the survey. To ensure that the sample was nationally representative, the percentages were matched to those obtained from the 2021 Population and Housing Census. The three key questions of the survey were statements that were placed on a rating scale starting from Strongly Disagree, Disagree, Neutral, Agree and Strongly agree, each of them with weights 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, respectively.The first statement was that John Dramani Mahama deserves to return as the presidential candidate of the NDC. The below chart indicates how the question was answered:123 delegates, representing 3.9% and 51 delegates, representing 1.6% of the sample, strongly agree or disagreed, respectively, that John Mahama deserves to return as Presidential Candidate of the National Democratic Congress (NDC). 247 delegates, representing 7.8% of the sample neither agreed nor disagreed with the statement. 1, 318 delegates, representing 41.9% and 1,408 representing 44.7% of the sample, agreed or strongly agreed, respectively that John Mahama deserves to return as Presidential Candidate of the party. This implies that the majority of delegates (86.6% in all) at the National Delegates Conference were of the view that John Dramani Mahama deserves to be retained as the flagbearer of the party. The reasons given by delegates for their preferences for John Mahama are presented in the analysis of verbatim responses.The next question asked to respondents was on the choice of running mate to the presidential candidate. Respondents were presented with the statement ‘Professor Jane Naana Opoku Agyeman deserves to return as the running mate of the NDC’. The below chart indicates how the delegates answered the question, based on the rating scale.Out of the total sample of 3,147 delegates interviewed, 1, 572, representing half of the sample strongly disagreed that Professor Jane Naana Opoku Agyeman deserves to return as the running mate of the NDC. In addition, 818 delegates, representing 26.0% of the sample, disagreed with the statement that the Professor deserves to return as the running mate of the NDC. However, 390 delegates, representing 12.4% of the delegates remained neutral on whether she deserved to return. A total of 629 respondents representing 11.6% of the sample were, however, in support of the Professor’s return as the running mate of the party. This includes 239 (7.6%) and 128 (4.0%) who strongly agreed, respectively, to the statement. The reasons given by the delegates for their choices are presented in the analysis of the verbatim.The last question asked to the delegates was to gauge the competence of the leadership of the NDC to shepherd the party to victory in the 2024 elections. 2,020 delegates, representing 64.2% of the sample, strongly agreed that the leadership of the NDC are competent enough to lead the party to victory in the 2024 elections. In addition, 828 delegates, representing 26.3% of the sample, agreed with the statement, whilst 254 remained neutral. A total of 45 delegates, representing 1.5% of the sample, did not agree that the leadership of the party are competent enough to lead the party to victory in the 2024 elections. The reasons given by delegates for their response to this question are presented in the analysis verbatim.Analysis of Open-Ended ResponsesUsing NVivo, a qualitative data analysis software, verbatim responses from delegates were analysed into several broad themes. These themes are based on all three questions asked to the delegates, and not on any specific one in particular. Current State of the Country – Ghana at the crossroadsSome of the delegates interviewed painted a picture of Ghana being at a crossroads, and that the next election was crucial to the survival of the NDC. The argument was that the leadership should put parochial interests aside and work to wrestle power from the NPP come the next elections.“We in the NDC must put our act together and not take the next election for granted. Look at where the country is heading…everything is in a mess; we are in a downward spiral and if we are not careful things will get worse because the incompetent NPP administration is at its wit's end. They have nothing to offer. Now that Ghanaians have seen their true colours, it is time we all rallied around JM and his running mate and achieve victory for the party come 2024. I urge the leadership of the party to listen to the grassroots and meet their demands” – Delegate from Volta Region“Ghanaians know why they rejected Akufo Addo 3 times, look at the way everything is sinking, the cedis, IMF bailout, haircut, etc. They even wanted to touch our pension funds. We need to come together as a party and rally around our leaders and rescue this sinking ship. We should save this country from this clueless and incompetent bunch of Akufo Addo and his cronies. Where are the men? – Delegate from Western North.Current State of Affairs in the NDCAnother theme that emerged from the open-ended responses was the current state of affairs in the party in terms of reported infighting or the existence of factions within the party, with individuals in certain quarters said to be bidding their time to enter the leadership race and hence not willing to throw their weight behind some executives. According to some respondents, if divisions in the party are not checked, it might lead to deep cracks heading into the next election without its founder Flt Jerry John Rawlings for the first time.“The NDC is a human institution and as such will have its fair share of problems. But we should work beyond our differences and ensure that we cruise to victory in the next election. Anything but a win will not be good for us. Whoever is selected as the new national executives should make party unity one of their key agendas” – Constituency Executive from Accra.“I want to remind the leadership of the party to consider what is at stake in the election 2024. The NPP know that they cannot win the election. Their time is up. So, they are stealing left right and centre. There is a lot at stake, and we need to select competent leaders to lead the party to victory next year” – Constituency executive from Western RegionThe Running Mate Debate and Succession PlanningAnother broad theme emerging from the open-ended data was the issue of the party’s running mate and the need for succession planning. Given that most of the delegates saw Mr Mahama as the most favoured to lead the party to the 2024 elections, there were concerns about his choice of running mate. This is due to the constitutional limit which allows Mr Mahama to govern for only one four-year term, and most of the delegates were of the view that Mahama would be essentially choosing his successor or endorsing the next presidential candidate of the party whether he likes it or not. And given that some party bigwigs are pushing for Professor Jane Naana Opoku Agyemang to be maintained as the running mate, some delegates have questioned whether she is the right person given her age, and how it plays out within the calculus of the 2028 election. The view is that marketing her and making her popular would not benefit the party in the long run. Delegates questioned whether she could withstand the exigencies of governing when inching close to 80 years in 2029. Despite her strong academic background and not being tagged as corrupt, there were questions about her charisma, and how she connects with the youth, especially the grassroots.  Some delegates also warned that the 2024 elections were so crucial that now is not the time to toy with being politically correct in fielding a running mate that would check the box of the party being woke to feminist demands.“The learned Professor has done her part. She should step aside. Maintaining her as the running mate would not help the chances of our party in 2024. We hope that the leadership of the party would listen to the voice of the grassroots. Most people are against maintaining the woman as the running mate. She has done well. The circumstances prevailing in 2020 are not the same as we are dealing with now. Ghanaians are yearning for a change, and we need a formidable team to wrestle power from the NPP. We should be looking at what is best for the party and not individual interests” – a delegate from Ketu South“If JDM comes only to fulfil his one-term bid and leaves the party in tatters, then he better gives way. As a beneficiary of a succession plan, he will go down the history of the party as a visionless leader who crashed the party because of the parochial interest of his brother and other interest groups” – a delegate from the Oti region.Historical Antecedents in Running Mate Selection in the NDCSeveral political watchers have waded into the deeply sensitive issue of a running mate for both the ruling NPP and the NDC. Some believe that historically, the NDC ticket has been such that it grabs the attention of Ghanaians, especially floating voters to sway them into voting for the party. Analysis of the open-ended responses shows that several delegates are not in favour of maintaining the professor because she does not bring much to the ticket in terms of charisma and arresting the attention of Ghanaians. “We tried her in the last election, and it did not work, why are we bringing her again? She is not the first woman to have been selected as the running mate of any political party, and she will not be the last. Go into our history and you would see that there have been others before her. The question is whether we need her now, considering her age, and other factors. We need a young fresh mind to run with our flagbearer. People are rooting for her because they know what they stand to gain when she runs. We will resist any attempt to bring her back as the running mate of the party. She has no charisma. She is too old. She cannot stand the venom of this election. The country and the party are at a crossroads, and we cannot risk or gamble our chances. This is the time to get a solid tick to blend with the youth who form the majority of the pollution of this nation. We want a young, fresh, and energetic person to stand with JM. We can’t gamble with the ticket, especially when we are competing with a party in power that is bent on doing anything to remain in power, including rigging the elections” – Delegate from Upper West.The Voice of the GrassrootsThe verbatim also suggests that some delegates thought the running mate slot should be someone who would be able to appeal not only to the base but to the masses who would be voting for the party. Some argued that the grassroots accounts for about 44% of the grassroots, and hence their voice should be heard. “Akufo Addo and his people are not interested in reshuffling their ministers. But from Papa J to Kufour, and Atta Mills, there was a lot of reshuffling, to which JM himself became a beneficiary and got into the political limelight. So, he should change the woman, and not bow to pressure from other parochial interests” – a delegate from NortheastImpact of a Female Running mate in Party Electoral Fortunes – The Case of GhanaThough Professor Jane Naana Opoku Agyemang is not the first to have featured as the running mate of a political party in Ghana, some delegates were of the view that the choice of a female running mate has no significant impact on party electoral fortunes. “With the professor, she was not able even to deliver her home region to the NDC in the last election, hence she did not add anything to the party in 2020. I strongly urge JM not to maintain her.”John Dramani Mahama is the most marketed candidate in NDC, but with a caveat.Most of the delegates saw John Mahama as the most marketed and also most charismatic within the political spectrum of the NDC. Several of them were of the view that he should be given the chance to complete his other four-year term, but that was with a caveat…that he will not run with the previous running mate, ie Professor Jane Naana Opoku Agyemang. They believe that doing so will not inure to the benefit of the party looking ahead into the 2028 elections. According to them, JDM must not put the Professor up to contest in the 2028 elections but a younger successor to avoid an open contest as it was in the case of the NPP’s famous 17 contestants that lead to the defeat of the NPP after the president Kufour’s rule.“JM must follow the party’s tradition of choosing a successor as his running mate to avoid needless contestation after his exit. Leaving the choice of a running mate to a flagbearer is a serious mistake on the part of the party, and in the future must be looked at to reflect the voice of the grassroots. This is because the choice of running mate in 2020 was poorly done, which lead to our defeat” – a delegate from Upper East.SummaryThis grassroots research report was conducted during the National Delegates Conference of the NDC held at the Accra Sports Stadium on 17 December 2022. A representative sample of 3,147 was achieved by the end of the conference. The 5-question, 5-minute survey was focused on the delegates' preferences and reasons for their preference for the presidential candidate, running mate and the leadership of the party, following questions on their region and constituency information. The sample size was achieved by random interviews of delegates using quotas based on the 2021 Population and Housing Census. The recorded interviews were transcribed and analysed using NVivo, a qualitative data analysis software. The findings showed that the majority of delegates would vote for John Mahama in the primaries, viewing him as the forerunner to all other candidates as he is the most marketed or marketable of all contenders for the slot. Again, a significant number of delegates rejected the idea of Prof. Jane Naana Opoku Agyemang as the running mate in the 2024 elections. The reasons given include the fact that she was too old, and her candidature would not be in the party’s interests in the long run. They argued that choosing her would be tantamount to endorsing a possible 2028 presidential bid by her, something they believe will not be feasible due to her advanced age.On their confidence that the leadership of the party are competent enough to steer the party to victory come 2024, the delegates were unequivocal, as most of them believe that the NDC has a competent team to lead the party to victory. There were however concerns about factionalism in the party, and the general lack of unity among the rank and file of the party. There were also concerns that parochial interests are sometimes put in place of the general membership of the party.ConclusionThe overarching message from the short survey is that the grassroots believe that John Mahama is the forerunner who would lead the party to victory in 2024. Though the study was not a census and did not seek the views of all the over 8,000 to 9,000 delegates who attended the conference, what was clear was that the views shared by respondents were representative of the total population of delegates considering the sampling approach used in the survey. There was also a high vote of confidence in the party hierarchy in leading the party to victory in 2024. Concerns about the lack of unity and factionalism within the party were also raised.RecommendationsThese recommendations are made based on the findings of the study, and it is hoped that the party hierarchy would consider them in their quest to wrestle power from the governing New Patriotic Party.1. Retain John Dramani Mahama as the presidential candidate of the party2. Consult widely, including the grassroots and start having discussions about the best replacement for Professor Jane Naana Opoku Agyemang3. Do not take the confidence the grassroots have in the party hierarchy for granted but work to iron out differences and foster greater unity among members.\",\n",

Why now? Clearly it is because he wants our votes but, trust me, we are not stupid\", a constituency executive said.\"I have been an active member of the NPP for many years, both under the old Western Region and the new Western North Region and I can say for a fact that I don\\'t remember any level of serious interaction and support Alan has had with us and members of the party in the region as a senior member of government. \"The relationship is is non existent, but what are we seeing today? He is here with his team to solicit our support to lead our party.

So if we see Dr. Bawumia here today and he says we should support him, it won\\'t be because of votes that he is here. We have already built the relationship and it will be the right time to back him and support him.\"Meanwhile, both NPP executives and delegates in the Western North have also expressed disappointment and anger over Alan\\'s campaign message which they say is aimed at attacking the NPP government.Several media have reported how the former Trade Minister has been telling delegates how bad the economy has been under the Akufo-Addo government and how it would be difficult for the NPP to even craft a campaign message for the 2024 elections.The delegates are angry that Mr. Alan Kyerematen, having been part of the Akufo-Addo government until last month, is subtly attacking the government because of his flagbearership ambition.\"It is quiet unfortunate that he is seeking to lead the NPP, yet he finds it convenient to attack the NPP government because he wants to take himself out for his presidential ambition.\"\"The question we delegates have been asking ourselves is that if you are attacking the NPP Government this way, which government\\'s record will you use to campaign as you seek to lead the party?\"',\n",

He has been the most lawless minister in Ghana’s history,” he declared.The MP indicated that the Minister has been inconsistent with the actual amount spent on the free senior high school policy and quoted different figures.Dr. Apaak said the Minister has over the years quoted 3.2 million, 7.2 million, and 5.3 million as costs for the policy.These figures he noted have been captured by parliament and yet the minister has refused to come before the committee to respond to questions.“In a functioning democracy, this could be the basis for his removal.

He added that NPP has launched more development initiatives than the NDC did while in power.Speaking in an interview with Wontumi TV, Nana Obiri Boahene argued that the NPP administration has done better in economic performance, by introducing a number of initiatives to support the economic well-being of the citizens to ensure that all the key economic indicators point to a positive direction.“You see, NPP we must accept the fact, if we’re supposed to speak the truth, we’re ahead of the NDC in so many ways. Just recently the vehicles that president Nana Addo donated to the Ghana Armed Force, over 175 cars. This has never happened in the history of Ghana. “For a sitting president to donate such items at a go. And this is a big plus for the NPP as a party. “But how do we tell Ghanaians about such implementations? We don’t communicate well with them. When they get the opportunity then they attack Asiedu Nketiah, Sammy Gyamfi and co which is not important. Because no matter what the NDC will do, they can never match up to the NPP. It is like comparing Abronye FC to Kotoko or Fatrikosei FC to Hearts of Oak.

Bawumia, on the other hand, will be the new candidate to join the race if he decides to contest.Being the Vice President who is always in the limelight, some party members believe Bawumia has an advantage over Alan who was a minister and was quite reserved.But Solomon Owusu, a member of the Alan Kyerematen campaign team, disagrees with those holding on to that opinion.To him, the so-called Bawumia’s popularity couldn’t win NPP a parliamentary seat in his constituency– Ayawaso East in the 2020 polls– unlike Alan whose influence helped the NPP maintain the Ayawaso West Wuogon seat within that period.“The 2020 Presidential and Parliamentary Election taught us how we have overrated some personalities in the NPP,” Owusu argued and went on to break down the numbers.Below is his statement;EXPOSING THE MYTHIn the Greater Accra Region, the 2020 Presidential and Parliamentary Election taught us how we have overrated some personalities in the NPP. The results of the 2020 Presidential elections in the Greater Region stood as follows:NPP: 1,253,179NDC: 1,326,489The difference between the NPP and the NDC was 73,310 votes. Curious enough, I decided to peruse the results from the various constituencies in the region to know which of the constituencies led to this difference of 73,310.A constituency that immediately came to mind was the Ayawaso East. Folks this constituency came into a sharp focus because the current Vice President ALHAJI Bawumia lives in Kanda which falls under the Ayawaso East constituency and so one was expecting the NPP to beat the NDC hands down based on two reasons which have been playing lately by the team members of the Vice President.The Ayawaso East constituency is predominantly a Muslim community and we have been told that the Vice President has what it takes to win votes in these areas to help the NPP and also the fact that the Vice President is that popular. Mind you, popularity could be positive or negative.The Presidential election results of Ayawaso East suggest to me that the Vice President is popular in the negative sense when it comes to his Neighbourhood.Ayawaso East constituency where the Vice President resides, sleeps, dances, eats and spends more time than any other Neighbourhood in this country produced the following Presidential Election outcome in 2020:NPP: 13,904NDC: 24,320Difference: 10,416.Folks remember I have already told you that the difference between the NDC and the NPP was 73,310. The difference in votes at the Ayawaso East constituency where the Vice President resides constitutes 14%.Apart from losing in the Presidential elections in that constituency, the NPP also lost in the parliamentary elections thereby leading to a hung parliament.',\n",

The president wants to hold the primaries in February next year which he said, his 2024 budget would have been passed by then. The MPs on the hand, also want the primaries held in August 2023, to give them enough room to do whatever it is that they have to do to keep the party in good shape.”“It doesn’t make sense and the party should not tolerate it, the party does not belong to the president and the party cannot go according to his timetable.”The party is supposed to elect its flagbearer 12 months to a general election when in power and two years when in opposition.This rule is in accordance with the NPP’s constitution.ESA\",\n",
       " 'The National Democratic Congress’ Deputy National Communications Director, Godwin Ako Gunn, has chastised the New Patriotic Party government for expending GH¢15 million on presidential car tyres and batteries.The criticism follows revelations by the North Tongu Member of Parliament, Samuel Okudzeto Ablakwa last Monday that the “tyres and batteries for official vehicles cost the suffering Ghanaian taxpayer an unbelievable GHC15million (15,000,000.00)”.The funds expended on the items covered the period ranging from January to September 2022, according to the Presidency’s documents on expenditure made available to Parliament.The expense, however, is considered to be inconsistent with the government’s calls on the public to burden share amidst the current economic crisis.In his reaction to the development, Mr. Ako Gunn said the funds could have been invested in Ghana’s indigenous tyre manufacturing company to produce a suitable one for the presidential fleet.“How much was needed to revive Bonsa tyres in the Western region? A company that could have easily supplied Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo with beautiful car tyres even with his name embossed on them,” he said.According to him, the money if it was invested in the local business, would have generated employment for the teeming youth who are still trying to find their feet.“This amount could have revived the tyre factory to employ our teeming youth who are struggling to be employed.”Read his reaction in detail belowONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY BILLION CEDIS FOR PRESIDENTIAL CAR TYRES (150,000,000,000)2/02/23By: Godwin Ako GunnHow much was needed to revive Bonsa tyres in the Western region?

Speaking in an interview with Happy FM, Koku Anyidoho further said some NDC members also accused him of killing his daughter - Sitsofe - for ritual purposes. “My little girl, Sitsofe Ablavi Mivormawu Anyidoho, died on 7th November (2020) then Rawlings died on the 12th. Asiedu Nketiah lives not too far from me, my little girl died, and they (NDC) didn’t even send a dog from the headquarters to commiserate with me. Not a single soul from the NDC came to commiserate with me,” he bemoaned. Koku Anyidoho added that, “The worst part is that... a close associate of John Mahama called Dzifa Gunu … wrote on social media that I killed my own 8-year-old daughter, I didn’t only kill her but I used her blood for ritual purposes.“They said I wanted to kill John Mahama and they know the shrines I visited in Benin, Togo, India and other places. And that my child died because God loves John Mahama,” he stated. According to Koku Anyidoho, he was taken aback that former president John Dramani Mahama has stayed mute over the allegations levelled against him, among other issues that reared its head up in the party. It would be recalled that Koku Anyidoho, in November 2020 lost his daughter, Sitsofe. The 8-year-old girl died in an accident while travelling with her mother.AM/ESA',\n",

Look, these processes are democratic and gives room for everyone to share their opinions. This is extensively consultative. So it is very unfortunate for people to go to Facebook and be making unfounded claims, especially known party activists. The party is not happy with that and we condemn that,” he stated in an interview on Asempa FM’s Ekosiisen monitored by GhanaWeb. However, Atick Yakubu in another post on his Facebook explained that he has had to hold fire due to the intervention of some persons he has respect for.The activist, however, said he will not be threatened for sharing his views.“For the sake of people we have much respect for, we will hold on and expect the best .

It comes with so many challenges and obstacles such as being tagged as a prostitute and even your own fellow woman hating on you”.She stated that mostly the prostitution tag is given the unmarried women interested in doing politics.“They assume you sleep with anyone at all, especially the big men in the industry to get you into whichever position you’re in or aspire to be in. This happens mostly when you’re quite close to the big men in question,” she added.She added that the second obstacle preventing women from doing politics is backbiting.“Some women are jealous of how you’re treated separately from them whenever you go out so they come together and plan your downfall,” she said.She emphasized that women are their own enemies. They don’t support each other and are always trying to compete amongst themselves.“We’re rather supposed to come together so we can move forward together but we don’t. Some women don’t want it that way. They will laugh with you and make you feel like they are for you, whereas they are the same ones bringing you down,” she mentioned.She advised young people especially women aspiring to be politicians to be humble, respectful and obedient.“You have to listen to everything those ahead of you tell you, and you also need to be attractive always and argue less,” she advised.',\n",

He said NPP cuts across all ethnic persuasions and always give opportunities to members in all its endeavours. He explained that the founding fathers of the party were not only Akans and that the foundation of the party was built on solid inter-ethnic persuasion without any prejudice to ethnic groups. Mr Gyato said the labelling of the NPP as an Akan party, especially by the people of northern decent and most instructively from the NDC was a smear campaign to create false impression to northerners that Akans in the NPP party dictated the pace in the party.

He was then the flagbearer for the United Front Party (UFP). Out of the 8 candidates on the ballot, Odike was eighth with 0.08%.Before the 2016 election, there was a misunderstanding in the UFP political party, and Odike was suspended for breach of the constitution after he made his son the General Secretary.Odike parted ways with UFP and founded the United Progressive Party with Razak Opoku. In 2019, they had a misunderstanding on who would be the leader of the party, and that led to a split.Speaking on Atinka TV’s morning show, Ghana Nie with Ama Gyenfa Ofosu Darkwa, Odike was of the view that partisan politics has sent the country backwards, recommending that the Union Government where everyone is allowed to participate in governance, will help make the nation better.“The Whites made Blacks understand that partisan politics or partisan democracy is what will help; it was lies they told Africans so that we cannot get the economic freedom we want but rather a stagnant economy in order to go behind us to steal our natural resources, so I Akwasi Addai Odike have left parties and brought a union government,” explains Akwasi Addai Odike.“I do not belong to any party again. Research has shown that partisan politics are destroying Africa, particularly Ghana,” he said.“The Union Government is a governance for all; it is a system running governance, so when we talk about governing the nation, we are all doing it,” he continued. \"There is also a governance where some people have formed parties that they will govern through, and we have noticed that these parties are what have brought the country down; they are not helping us to move forward. \"If we want to make a difference, then these party systems will not help us, they bring division, war, selfishness, and people prioritising their party over the country. “That is what is happening, and it is not helping,” he said.He said partisan politics is what is affecting Ghana, saying that without changing, Ghana will remain the same.Mr Odike also said the 1992 constitution is archaic, over 30 years old and needs to be changed.He observed that although people make suggestions and complain, the government always decide for the people, saying that with the Union Government, everyone’s view will be taken into consideration while policies are being formulated.',\n",

       " ' A former executive member of the Tema East Constituency branch of the opposition National Democratic Congress (NDC), Stephen Ashitey Adjei, has said former Finance Minister, Dr. Kwabena Duffuor will polish the image of the NDC if he becomes party leader. In the latest of his public musings on the state of the party, Mr. Ashitey Adjei, who is popularly called Moshake, said Dr. Duffuor would do this by deodorizing the party of the “battered image that John Mahama has saddled it with.” “If we make Duffuor our flagbearer and leader, we will no longer have to spend time, energy, and resources to mount defense campaigns as to why our leader is incompetent or corrupt because Duffuor does not have any of these dogging him as Mahama does,” Moshake wrote. According to him, the NDC is in pole position to win the 2024 election but that to do so easily, the party has to present a new and fresh leader to voters. “If you listen to the grounds, you realize that voters are ready to vote for the NDC because they feel disappointed and let down by the NPP government. However, the Mahama brand looks tired to many and often you will hear voters ask whether apart from John Mahama we do not have anyone else,” Moshake wrote. Moshake answers himself, “of course we do; we have many more capable presidential materials, including Dr. Duffuor.” The National Democratic Congress (NDC) is rumoured to be readying for its congress to elect its presidential candidate in May and in the upcoming contest, Dr. Kwabena Duffuor is regarded by many as the answer to the NDC’s eight year failure to clinch power with former president John Mahama. However, Mr. Mahama’s camp has been pushing hard to get him elected again, setting up a situation where the party’s delegates are left with the crucial responsibility and duty of determining the NDC’s future with their votes. Moshake has long been hammering on the fact that the party’s biggest predicament is former President John Mahama who while in office as president, allowed himself to be branded as an incompetent man. It is the former Tema East NDC Constituency executive member’s position that if the NDC sets aside Mr. Mahama and elects a new leader, the party’s poor appeal to the voters will be cured. “Fortunately, we have Dr. Kwabena Duffuor in the race for the 2024 presidential ticket and the NDC has responsibility to itself and the people of this country to elect him as flagbearer so as to polish the image of the party of the Mahama stain.” He warned that posterity will not forgive the NDC if it does not\\xa0do\\xa0the\\xa0needful.',\n",

The closest contenders to Dr Bawumia are Alan Kyerematen and Kennedy Agyapong respectively. \"It is worth noting that some PSEs (12.3%) indicated they have not yet decided on whom to vote for, but that does not significantly change the outcome,” the researchers said in their final report.“Data was obtained mainly through computer-assisted personal interviewing (CAPI) technology between 15th November 2022 and 15th December 2022.

       " '\"I was brought up in a good home, attended a good school and I am my own man who would not allow myself to be corrupted,\" former deputy General Secretary of the National Democratic Congress (NDC), Koku Anyidoho explains falling out with Asiedu Nketiah.According to him, Asiedu Nketiah at the time wanted him to malign President Akufo-Addo and now Executive Director, Economic and Organised Crime Office (EOCO), Maame Yaa Tiwaa Addo-Danquah and his refusal to do so led to him (Asiedu Nketiah) coming after him (Koku Anyidoho).Koku Anyidoho was arrested in March 2018 and held by the BNI after a press conference organized by the Inter-Party Coalition for National Sovereignty at the International Press Centre in Accra.He is alleged to have made remarks that there would be a social revolution during the tenure of President Nana Akufo-Addo.After he was released, Koku Anyidoho claims Asiedu Nketiah urged him to embark on a media tour to malign the President and CID boss at the time, Maame Yaa Tiwaa Addo-Danquah for maltreating him in custody when he was treated with all respect.“I was the assistant of Asiedu Nketiah at the time and he asked me to insult the President and Maame Yaa Tiwaa Addo-Danquah after I was released from BNI cells and I refused. That is how Asiedu Nketiah and I fell out. \"We fell out because I wasn’t going to lie about how I was treated whilst in BNI cells. I was treated with respect and I wasn’t going to lie about that because I don’t do anyone’s bidding. \"I wasn’t going to allow politics turn me into an idiot or a slave to another,” he submitted in an interview with Happy 98.9 FM’s Don Kwabena Prah on the ‘Epa Hoa Daben’ political talk show.The politician revealed Asiedu Nketiah also got some party faithful to spread rumors he (Koku Anyidoho) had taken money from President Akufo-Addo, hence his refusal to take them on for treating him badly when he was locked up in a BNI cell.He described Asiedu Nketiah as a petty and wicked leader who has no good intentions for the NDC.']"
