       "\"The Ashanti Regional Women's Organiser of the National Democratic Congress (NDC), Gloria Huze, has said that the enemy going into the 2024 general elections is not one that is within the party, and as such, her National Women’s Organiser, Dr. Hanna Bissiw, should focus her arsenals elsewhere. Reacting to the statement made by Hanna Bissiw after she, Gloria Huze, picked up nomination forms on behalf of one of the aspirants in the race to become the NDC’s flagbearer, Dr. Kwabena Duffuor. Huze had led some grassroot members of the NDC to pick the forms on behalf of the former Minister of Finance, but had been called out by Hanna Bissiw thereafter, stating that her action was without the support of the national government. “My attention has been drawn to a deplorable and unacceptable action by the Ashanti Regional Women's Organiser, Gloria Huze, in the upcoming flagbearer race. “She is on record to have led a delegation to pick up the nomination form for a Presidential Candidate Aspirant in the name of the Ashanti Regional Women's Wing.“I vehemently and categorically disassociate the wing from her conduct and wish to state emphatically that her conduct is not in any way a representation of any parts of the wing either in the Ashanti Region or across the other 15 regions in the country,” parts of the statement copied to GhanaWeb read.But in a response, Gloria Huze has stated that what she did do so on behalf of the women’s wing of the party.“For the avoidance of doubt and to set the record straight, I led NDC grassroots members whom I was representing, NOT the Ashanti Regional Women’s Wing NOR the Women Wing of our party as it is being alleged.“I have clarified my statement on several platforms including radio stations among others,” she said in a disclaimer. Gloria Huze further stated that while she is quite surprised at the response by Dr. Hanna Bissiw, she expected that the focus would rather be on how the NDC can rather reclaim power from the incumbent New Patriotic Party. She stated that beyond the internal differences they have, she expects that such energies would be directed at their external opponents as the goal is for the party to win power in 2024. She, therefore, apologized for any errors she may have committed, while calling for moderation in the way such matters are handled in the party, so as not to escalate tensions and tear the NDC up from within. “I wish to indicate to all party members that we have a common enemy to gather our arsenals for but not ourselves, irrespective of our preferences in our internal elections. At the end of the day, every one of us is needed at the table and on the field to push our common agenda of removing the NPP from power. This will be critical regardless of our individual preferences. “We should therefore exercise moderation and not attempt to escalate verbal slips to make a whole issue that has the tendency of creating avoidable disunity. Whilst I acknowledge my verbal slips and apologize for whatever inconvenience it might have caused, I believe my clarification should put the matter to rest,” she added. Dr. Kwabena Duffuor has picked up nomination forms to contest the position of the flagbearer of the NDC, and is expecting to face off with the former president of Ghana, John Dramani Mahama.

       "['Broadcaster, Bridget Otoo is puzzled over Kwabena Duffour Jnr’s decision to contest in the National Democratic Congress (NDC) parliamentary primaries despite his unimpressive performance as a leader when he served in different capacities. Duffour Jnr is eyeing the Sekyere Afram Plains seat which is being occupied by NDC’s Alex Adomako Mensah. Dr. Kwabena Duffour Jnr holds a Ph.D. and M.Sc. in Banking and International Finance from Cass Business School, United Kingdom respectively. He has also worked with the Ghana International Bank Plc London - Treasury Department and with Star Assurance Company Limited as an underwriter trainee and now wants to become a politician. Commenting on the development, Bridget Otoo in a tweet, Friday, could not fathom why Duffour Jnr would want to become a parliamentarian when he has on some occasions failed to function as a leader. \"I heard Kwabena Duffour Jnr also wants to go to Parliament? Wow. The guy who held a party the day EIB staff were on strike over unpaid salaries? Such an insensitive person wants to go to parliament. We need better people in politics, not out of touch self-centered people,\" her tweet sighted by GhanaWeb read.“For a moment think about why Kwabena Duffour Jnr wants to go to parliament. He couldn’t manage a bank, can’t pay his staff over mismanagement, holds a party the day his staff are on strike to show them he really doesn’t care.

       " 'Member of Parliament (MP) for Akim Swedru in the Eastern Region, Kennedy Osei Nyarko has said Vice President, Dr. Mahammudu Bawumia poses a threat to the main opposition National Democratic Party (NDC).Kennedy Osei Nyarko is convinced former President John Dramani Mahama is no competition for Vice President Dr. Mahamudu Bawumia, when it comes to debating on national issues.He said, “Dr Bawumia continues to be a nightmare and albatross on the neck of the NDC.”“He has always taken the biggest opposition party on policies and on innovative ideas implementations. No wonder they will not stop at anything to attack and denigrate him. He is the nightmare of the NDC. We want someone who will take the fight to the opponent and not the one who will rather fight the one fighting the opponent,” Kennedy Osei Nyarko wrote on his official Facebook wall.“It seems that Dr. Bawumia is a problem for his political rivals. I’ve been involved in Ghanaian politics for a very long time, and I can attest that Dr. Bawumia is one of our country’s top communicators. He is coherent, articulate, and laser-focused.”He added: “He makes economics very simple. He is able to reduce very complicated issues, so, I see why he represents a problem and a challenge for some people. I think the town hall meeting was a useful exercise.”',\n",
       " 'A few days after the nomination form was picked for former President John Mahama to lead the largest opposition party, the National Democratic Congress (NDC), into the 2024 presidential election, a staunch member of the party, Ambassador Kwesi Ahwoi has suggested that Prof. Jane Naana Opoku-Agyemang deserves to be retained as running mate.In an exclusive interview with Starr News Eastern Regional Correspondent, Kojo Ansah at the sidelines of an event at Koforidua Technical University on Friday, Kwesi Ahwoi said even though former President Mahama has the prerogative right to appoint any running mate of choice, nothing stops him from re-appointing his 2020 running mate to partner him again into 2024.“I have made a lot of statements. I have made a statement that I will do everything to make sure President John Mahama comes back to be President of this country and of course, he has to decide who will be his running mate. I don’t see anything wrong at all and nothing that stops Prof. Jane Naana Opoku Agyemang from being the running mate”. Ambassador Kwesi Ahwoi stated.The former Interior Minister and current Chairman of Former Ambassadors and High Commissioners under the NDC, dismissed old-age arguments against Prof.Jaane Naana Opoku Agyemang. He said Prof.Jane Naana Opoku Agyemang, can rise to become the next President after John Mahama.“People are talking about age and all. Age is not a concern. Age is being made a concern because we have a leadership today that is making age look like we have lost track. But if I tell you my age standing here you will be amazed but I have not lost track. So Naana whether she is 78, 79, or 80 can still be President of this country when President John Mahama finishes his service, that should not be a worry at all. Senior Kwabena Duffuor is putting in his cap. Kwabena Duffuor should be getting close to 79, what does he get to do with that, he got his brains, he got everything that he can use to lead this country.so I don’t see anything wrong with that(old age), Is it because Naana is a woman?” he quizzed.Ambassador Kwesi Ahwoi said it is about time women are given opportunity to rule the country given the fact that men have been tried enough.“It is about time we put a woman in charge of this country . They have a lot to offer this country. We have tried men, we’ve seen where men have taken us. Let’s try the women”.Answering a question about whether or not Prof. Jaane Naana Opoku-Agyemang, will attract more votes for the NDC when made running mate to seal the party’s victory, Kwasi Ahwoi said Central region is an amorphous region therefore the seemingly poor performance of the party in 2020 should not be a litmus test for her re-appointment as running mate.“It is the party that brings numbers it is not really the individual….if the party is strong the candidate is only a reflection of the party. But specifically, she also has her constituency, she can pull resources, and she can pull people. Most people are not calculating things well they think we lost in the central region. We lost the presidential election in Centralia Region because people forget that the central region is an amorphous region. It is not only Fantes. Central region is a combination of Ashantes, Akyems, Denkyiras just name it so don’t look at Fante and say because Naana is a Fante he should bring Central region, no! We have to go beyond that”.Prof Jane Naana Opoku-Agyemang, an academician, the first female Vice-Chancellor of the University of Cape Coast, and a former Education Minister was the running mate for the 2020 Presidential candidate of NDC John Dramani Mahama.However, lost the election to incumbent President Nana Akufo-Addo of the ruling New Patriotic Party who polled 6,730,587 represented 51.30% as against 6,213,182 vote representing 47.36% polled by John Dramani Mahama of the NDC.',\n",

       " 'A senior lecturer at the University Ghana Political Science Department, Dr. Kwame Asah Asante has said that the country will be able to forgo the IMF bailout and its conditions if the government manages corruption well.Ghana officially contacted the International Monetary Fund to seek financial support. The external creditors provided Ghana with a certain criterion the country must meet to secure a possible $3 billion bailout.The government introduced the Domestic Debt Exchange Program (DDEP) to restructure debt as part of the steps to reach board-level approval with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) on a $3 billion facility to restore macroeconomic stability in the country.The government targeted 80% participation in the program to help restructure 137.3 billion Ghana cedis in bonds on the domestic market to bring its total debt, which stands at about 575.5 billion Ghana cedis to sustainable levels.Speaking on Morning Starr the Political Scientist said that the government’s mismanagement of corruption is the reason we need to accept all these conditionalities from IMF for a possible bailout.“We are so excited that IMF is going to give us close to 3 billion for starters and all that. But if we manage corruption very well, I’m afraid we will not need that money with its attendant problems and conditions. Let’s look at the issue of waste and a lot of information are available within the auditor general’s report year by year. How far have we come, and how far have we learned from them to continue to see these things in our books? It is unfortunate.“If you look at issue of waste, in terms of projects we pursue. Projects that have little or no benefit for society and then we are in there. We undertake projects without records of stakeholder engagement, and when people raise their voices those projects become abandoned and we adjust to devising such projects. We have seen issues of misapplication of state resources. In the sense that the constitution makes it mandatory for all government that when you inherit power, any project that is done using state money you will continue,” Dr. Asante explained.He continued; “But there are buildings today that are languishing in the bush and that we don’t seem to care about it. we forget that state money was put into such resources. Look at the way we execute contracts in this country as if there is no supervisor of contracts that the state has awarded. We do it anyhow and people benefit from that through poor supervision and poor execution of state projects. What is more, is that we see even some is that we see of these contracts ending up in judgement debt.”',\n",

       " \"Presidential hopeful of the New Patriotic Party (NPP), Alan Kyerematen, has described the economic policies pursued over the years by several governments as a 'cul de sac.'Speaking on URA Radio in Bolgatanga in the Upper East leg of his nationwide tour, Alan Kyerematen pointed out that the narrow focus of Ghana's continued reliance on cocoa, gold, and a few primary raw material exports, is a cul de sac orientation to economic management, and which has limited growth in the economy. Doing things the same way over and over returns the same results. Cocoa, for example, has brought in under $2billion per annum into the Ghanaian economy annually over the past decades. However, the President's Special Intitiatives (PSIs), initiated by Alan Kyerematen, comprising four simple local products: salt, oil palm, cassava and garments, could have unleashed a potential combined annual income stream of $60b a year. However, policy distortion and irregular political choices reduced the nations' capacity to grow and benefit from the PSI's. Currently, the ten point strategic growth pillars developed and being implemented under Hon. Kyerematen, during his tenure as Minister for Trade and Industry, has brought in 1D1F, the automotive industry, and others. Speaking to the Great Transformational Plan  (GTP), Alan inspires that the country deserves leadership with a big vision. A vision that moves us beyond the cul de sac into strategic growth areas following through on the GTP. Alan Kyerematen is also primary to the design, establishment and implementation of the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA), which brings together a market of nearly a billion and a half consumers for producers within the diversified economy necessary to expand opportunities for the youth. On the same programme, Mr Alan Kyerematen reiterated his desire to modernise the New Patriotic Party (NPP) into a formidable force to better drive public policy and thence enable better mobilisation of communities towards opportunities. Not only will he create a businesslike Party, capable of generating independent financial, technical and human resources but also a big voice into Government appointments, especially at local level.

Because all the ministries cannot bring their programmes to cabinet meetings so these committees collect all the programmes of ministries under them and present them during the meetings.“But when it comes to the management of the economy, it is the Economic Management Team that has been responsible for it since and nobody should run away from it,”  he said Twi.He questioned why the chairperson of the Economic Committee does not address Ghanaians on the economy if s/he is indeed superior to the head of the Economic Management Team, who is required to do so.Watch the interview below:Meanwhile, catch the latest GhanaWeb TV Election Desk interview with Francis Addai-Nimoh, as he discusses his plans to become the NPP's flagbearer, below:You can also watch this episode of People & Places on GhanaWeb TV below:IB/OGB\",\n",
       " \"The Deputy Minister for Energy, Andrew Egyapa Mercer, has stated that Vice President Mahamudu Bawumia has his complete support for the New Patriotic Party (NPP) presidential primaries.According to him, even though he has good relations with all the people who have stated their intention of contesting in the primaries, Bawumia has proven that he is the best among them.Speaking in an Adom TV interview monitored by GhanaWeb, he added that the ideal situation would be for the NPP to have Bawumia as the presidential candidate of the party and the Minister for Energy, Dr. Matthew Opoku Prempeh (NAPO), as his running mate.“I support Bawumia 500%. This is an internal election… All the people who have expressed interest in contesting in the primaries are eminently qualified and they have all worked for the New Patriotic Party.“But when I look at the entirety of the eminent personals, I think that His Excellence the Vice President stands tall, no matter how you look at it – his competencies, his track record, his personality (how he relates with people), the digitalisation agenda that he is driving to transform the face of our economy,” he said in Twi.The Deputy Minister for Energy, who is also the Member of Parliament for Sekondi, described Dr. Matthew Opoku Prempeh, as a machine who together with Bawumia will transform Ghana.“It is my prayer that if by God’s grace, Dr Bawumia becomes our flagbearer, his running mate will be Dr Matthew Opoku Prempeh. Dr Matthew Opoku Prempeh is a machine and we need a machine to deliver,” he said.The MP also said that he is confident that the Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo government will turn things after the International Monetary Fund (IMF) bailout it is seeking is completed.The likes of the former Trade and Industry Minister Alan Kyerematen Assin, Central MP Ken Agyapong, Vice President Dr. Mahamudu Bawumia, the former Food and Agriculture Minister, Dr. Owusu Afriyie Akoto, ex-Mampong MP Francis Addai-Nimoh and Regional Cooperation Minister Dr Kofi Konadu Apreku, are expected to face off in the race for the flagbearership position of the NPP.Watch the interview below:Meanwhile, catch the latest GhanaWeb TV Election Desk interview with Francis Addai-Nimoh, as he discusses his plans to become the NPP's flagbearer, below:You can also watch this episode of People & Places on GhanaWeb TV below:IB/OGB\",\n",
       " 'The spokesperson of Vice President Dr. Mahamudu Bawumia, Dr. Gideon Boako, has revealed that any of the candidates contesting for the New Patriotic Party’s (NPP) flagbearership who gets the support of five incumbent Members of Parliament(MP) in the Ashanti region will win the election.He was also quick to shoot down claims from pro-Alan elements that Dr. Bawumia as flagbearer will reduce the votes of the party in the Ashanti Region; arguing that the Vice President has over the years endeared to the people of the Ashanti Region even more than candidates from the region.Dr. Gideon Boako was speaking on Wontumi Radio when he made this known.“The Ashantis are not looking for people who will just say I can trace my roots there or they come from that place. They are looking for someone who will relate well with them and not have the boss, subordinate relationship.You can be from there but you are not humble enough to have time for the party members. They see Bawumia and he is like a son to the Ashantis. He endears so much to the party and they know him very well. He comes for funerals and joins most social gatherings in the region. During campaigns, he’s the one they see. You can say you are from the Ashanti Region but have the people seen you campaigning for the party in the region before?\"If you want a position in the NPP and you tell the people from Ashanti Region that they have to vote for you, what the NPP members in the Ashanti Region will ask you is when was the last time you came to Bosome Freho or Ejura to campaign. They can say that Bawumia who you claim is not from Ashanti Region 2020, 2016 campaign we were with him in the Ashanti Region.The Ashanti party is closer to Bawumia than anything. This is right from the grassroots. When we come to the Ashanti Region, you’ll get lots of the chairmen, and constituency chairmen following Vice President.Out of the number of MPs in the Ashanti Region, if any candidate apart from Bawumia is able to get more than five MPs supporting them, I will say they will win the election. Bawumia will have the support. Bawumia will get not less than 80% of the Ashanti MPs supporting him. When some persons who said they are from the Ashanti Region went back home, they had only two MPs behind them. But when Bawumia is in the Ashanti Region, he has full support from the grassroots upwards. This is an indication of who the people want. Per what I’ve seen, there’s no candidate who can command even 30% of the Ashanti Region votes apart from Bawumia,” he said.',\n",

Meanwhile, scores of individuals believed to be in the camp of Dr. Duffour, earlier on Thursday, thronged the NDC headquarters, singing and cheering for him.Dressed in party colours, with various party paraphernalia and wielding placards with posters of Dr. Duffour, these enthusiasts threw their support behind Dr. Duffour, while one of the party’s theme songs played in the background.This comes after representatives of Former President, John Dramani Mahama, Former Kumasi Mayor, Kojo Bonsu and Businessman, Ernest Kwaku Korbeah all picked up their nomination forms on Wednesday, February 22, 2023.The forms pegged at 30,000 Ghana Cedis will be filled and returned to the party’s Elections Committee.

       " ' Lawyer Wahid Bampuori-Iddrisu has picked parliamentary candidate nominee forms to contest the primaries on the ticket of the National Democratic Congress on May 13, 2023. The Accra-based senior party member and legal practitioner has consistently contested the seat in Wa Central. This is his third attempt he’s seeking to annex the seat from the incumbent Rashid Pelpuo. The information available to GhanaWeb indicates that Mr. Bampuori-Iddrrisu (Esq) is the preferred candidate for most party stakeholders and stalwarts in the constituency. According to a constituency executive, among other things, “Wahid’s consistency and commitment to party activities though he lost the primaries on two occasions is giving him some sympathy and sense of acceptance”. The source added that Wahid has a very good message that is being delivered on a clean and honest campaign. The 56-year-old legal luminary was also described as genuinely generous, friendly, and well-networked enough to lead the party in parliament. \"He was the first and only member of the NDC that has constructed and donated two party offices  which he built from his own resources to the constituency,\" the source added. The constituency seems to be drifting away from the 18 years of leadership of the incumbent and 12 years of neglect of the constituency by Hudu Mogtari to the generous lawyer and founding member of the party. The Wa Central seat will be keenly contested but critics observe that Lawyer Wahid’s team is too slow and seems drowned in the cross-fire between Rashid Pelpuo and Hudu Mogtari\\'s teams.

       " \"The Deputy Spokesperson for Alan Kyerematen, Richard Nyamah, has claimed that it is because a powerful person within the New Patriotic Party (NPP) heavily invested in the campaign of the sitting Member of Parliament for Adenta, Mohammed Adamu Ramadan, that he won the seat. It is worth noting that the current MP is a member of the opposition National Democratic Congress (NDC), but is also the sister of the wife of the vice president, Samira Bawumia. According to Richard Nyamah, the only reason Yaw Buaben Asamoa, a one-time MP for the Adentan constituency was unable to retain that seat is because of the contributions of this powerful person, who he described as Annoh-Dompreh's preferred choice.  He said this while reacting to an earlier interview of the Majority Chief Whip in Parliament, Frank Annoh-Dompreh, on Adom TV, where the legislator dared Buaben Asamoa to win back the Adenta seat which has, for many years, been a New Patriotic Party (NPP) seat. “The Hon MP further went ahead to malign Hon Yaw Buaben Asamoa, former MP for Adentan and former Director of NPP Party Communications, now Spokesperson and Director of Communications for the Alan Kyerematen Campaign, by casting untrue aspersions on his person and character and then cheekily damning him to dare to win back the Adentan Parliamentary Seat, lost to the Party in the 2020 General elections. The real question is why and how the seat was lost. “If the Hon Annoh-Dompreh is not familiar with the story of how his preferred candidate for leadership of the NPP reportedly helped invest heavily in his brother-in-law to gift an NPP held seat to our main opponents, then he is indeed doing the High Office of Chief Whip an injustice. “It is the business of the Chief Whip to have his finger on the pulse of the Party but his aspersions in respect of Adentan Constituency show that either he is not on top of his game or that he has deliberately blinded himself to further the interests of his preferred candidate, even if the parliamentary preferences of his candidate have been hurtful to the fortunes of the NPP.  Now the question that begs answering is, will Annoh-Dompreh be singing praises to his preferred candidate if he was destooled by his brother-in-law from the NDC with the tacit support of the Vice President of the land?” he wrote. Richard Nyamah also refuted claims by the MP that Alan Kyerematen was in charge of an Economic Management Committee. He indicated that there is no such committee and that if there is, then Frank Annoh-Dompreh should produce its members, as well as its mandate.

       " 'Director of Communications for the governing New Patriotic Party (NPP), Richard Ahiagbah has stated that the Akufo-Addo government is on course to restore the country’s economic stability and growth that existed before the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic.Addressing the press at the party headquarters in Aslym Down, Accra, today Wednesday 22 February 2023, Richard Ahiagbah, said the government’s Post Covid-19 Program for Economic Growth (PC-PEG) is a solid blueprint that is ushering the country out of the economic setback the people of Ghana have had to endure the last 12months.NDC’s poor recordBefore he outlined the recovery plans of the Akufo-Addo administration, Mr. Ahiagbah, took a swipe at the opposition National Democratic Congress (NDC) for what he says is a deliberate effort on the part of the opposition party to “misled many Ghanaians to think that [the Akufo-Addo government] has mismanaged the economy since assuming office”.“This claim by the NDC however is not supported by the hard economic data and the reality around the world. In all these, the NDC has not provided any credible alternative solution(s). They are talking a lot but not about solutions.  It is blame, mischaracterization, and denial of obvious global economic realities” Richard Ahiagbah said. Supporting his argument on the “poor performance” of the NDC when they were in office between 2013 and 2016, Ahiagbah said, “on the larger economy which is measured in terms of GDP the NDC, supervised a perpetual decline from 2013 to 2016”.“In 2013, GDP was 7.3%; in 2014 it was 4%; in 2015 it was 3.9% and in 2016 it was 3.7%. In terms of percentage changes in the GPD, the economy deteriorated by 45.2% in 2014 compared to 2013 growth. Similarly, the economy decreased by 2.5% in 2015 and 5.12% in 2016.“In the Real Sector, which includes Agriculture, Industry, and Service, the NDC’s performance was even worst. From 2013, real sector growth plummeted significantly across all sectors. In 2014 all the sectors grew at a negative rate using 2013 performance as a base” Mr. Ahiagbah said.“Let me remind you that this poor performance was against the NDC inheriting an economy that had discovered oil in commercial quantities and began production in 2010; which shot Ghana’s GDP to 14% in 2011.  All that growth momentum was vanquished by the NDC, led by Ex-President Mahama” he added. NPP’s outstanding performanceComparing the NDC’s performance with the NPP’s time in office before the COVID-19 pandemic and the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the NPP’s director of communications noted that available data shows that the “NPP turned around the contracting economy it inherited from the NDC in 2017 to date”.“On GDP, 2017 GDP grew at 8.1 percent compared to 3.7 percent in 2016, 2018 GDP grew by 6.3%, 2019 GDP grew by 6.5% and 2020 GDP grew by 0.5%. In the real rector, the industry recorded its highest growth of 16.7% in 2017, with Agriculture at 8.4%, and the Services sectors at 4.3%.“Industry grew from a mournful negative 0.5% in 2016 to 16.7 percent in 2017 and Services grew from 2.8% in 2016 to an appreciable 4.3% in 2017,” Ahiagbah said.“The Agric sector also grew from a dismal 2.7% in 2016 to 8.4% in 2017. Friends from the media, this data we just reviewed imply that the vulnerable in our society, the poor, indeed, the vast majority of Ghanaians fared much better under NPP in 2017. Data is sacred” he added.Recovery planAs part of the recovery plan, Mr. Ahiagbah said “Government has introduced the Post Covid-19 Program for Economic Growth (PC-PEG) to among others establish a sustainable macro-fiscal path, restore debt sustainability and macro-economic stability underpinned by key structural reform and social protection”.According to Richard Ahiagbah, “the PC-PEG will address the economic challenges of this country through fiscal consolidation, get treatment, and structural reform” and that “Government through the Central Bank has responded with a raft of monetary policy measures, including the bi-weekly FX forward auction, and the BDC forex auction which has helped subdue the pressure on the spot FX market”.“To complement the monetary policies which have been activated, the Government has subsequently announced Expenditure-led measures including a 30% cut in discretionary expenditures, a moratorium on the new creation of government units, a freeze on government travels, 30 percent cut in salaries of the executive and political appointees, among others,” Ahiagbah said.“Other policies such as the implementation of the Gold for Oil (G4O) program, implementation of the COVID-19 Alleviation & Revitalization of Enterprises Support (CARES) Program, to inject some Ghc100 billion into the economy” [are all part of the larger strategy of the government to the country’s economic stability] Ahiagbah added.“Government’s transformative agenda to digitalize the economy [which is aimed at formalizing] the Ghanaian economy & improve its administrative systems & global competitiveness, the banking sector reforms which has introduced a tighter regulatory & supervisory framework in the sector are all part of the steps government is taking to revive the economy.“Through these innovative measures, the government is demonstrating its resolve to build back the economy quickly and restore fiscal rectitude. Government’s commitment to these measures is a clear assurance that we are on the right track and capable of causing a turnaround of the economy with the resolute support of all Ghanaians” Richard Ahiagbah further stated.Way Forward for EconomyIn his press statement, the NPP\\'s director of communications identified several thematic areas that the government is paying attention to tackle the prevailing economic challenges.Mr. Ahiagbah noted that in 2022, the government introduced a raft of fiscal and monetary measures to rein in expenditures and improve revenue mobilization, including a cut in discretionary spending, a cut in the salaries of the executives, a freeze on foreign travel, among others\".\"The 2023 budget indicates the government’s desire to continue fiscal consolidation efforts and reduce the fiscal deficit in line with the pending IMF Programme. The government expects to record one of the lowest deficits this year, much lower than the GH¢64.0 billion announced in the 2023 budget\" Ahiagbah said.\"Expenditure measures, the debt treatment program, and structural reforms, among others, are all measures that the Akufo-Addo administration has embarked on to ensure that the economy is stabilized and subsequently made to grow as was the case before the COVID-19 pandemic\" Ahiagbah added.',\n",
       " 'The Director of Communications of the governing New Patriotic Party (NPP) has stated that the party is unperturbed by the decision of former president John Dramani Mahama to run for president in the 2024 general elections.Richard Ahiagbah told press men (February 22) that having defeated Mahama twice (in 2016 and 2020), the NPP has no fears facing him for a third consecutive time.“We have beaten him twice, so you just conclude for yourself if we are afraid of him. It is all mathematical, and we have defeated him twice. He is even afraid to plainly declare whether he is going to contest or not. We are ready for him.”According to Ahiagbah, the NPP\\'s major preoccupation now is to improve the economy and ease the cost of living crisis that citizens have been faced with for the past few months.“We are interested in how we can build our economy, and we want to know whether he has the solution because we saw him vanquish the gains that he got, and we saw him collapse our economy and banking sector. \"He doesn’t have what it takes to improve Ghana because if he had what it took to do that, he wouldn’t have vanquished our economic gains and taken us to the IMF,” he stressed.Mahama declares bid, picks nomination formsMahama\\'s formal intention to run for a third consecutive shot at the presidency was reported when a number of NDC MPs confirmed that he was going to contest.On February 22, forms were picked on his behalf by Prof. Alabi and regional chairmen amid fanfare.

Other than that, it will be politically suicidal for the NPP in the 2024 general election”, he added.Describing him as the choice for all, Nana Busia said “as a great party we can’t overlook our political history and pick any wrong choice to lead us because posterity would not spare us if we do so”.',\n",
       " 'The General Secretary of the Convention People’s Party (CPP), Nana Yaa Jantuah has hit hard at the NPP government for keeping Finance Minister, Ken Ofori-Atta, in office months after the country’s economy deteriorated.The former Public Affairs Director for the Public Utilities Regulatory Commission (PURC) who was speaking on Power FM’s Inside Politics programme wondered why the minister was still in office after Ghana borrowed so hugely in a debt distress level.“Ken Ofori-Atta abon [Ken Ofori-Atta is incompetent],” she said in Akan while explaining that the finance minister is highly incompetent and unintelligent for allowing the economy to slowly grind to a halt amid warnings from experts.“When I call them F9 (unintelligent) ministers people want to come after me but that is who they are: non-performing ministers,” she argued.Yaa Jantuah said times are hard that the working class and the ordinary people cannot afford a 3 square meal which was possible before the NPP took over power in 2017.The hardship, she explained, was as a result of the inflationary spiral fuelled by a steep depreciation of the cedi which was not managed for a long time.To her, President Akufo-Addo should have sacked Ofori-Atta long before the economy got crushed to a point that the country cannot pay for its domestic and external debts.Experts and rating agents have described Ghana’s economy as one that is in a huge debt crisis.Finding a way to handle the government’s debts internationally, Finance Minister Ofori-Atta recently disclosed that the government has initiated talks with China over Ghana’s debt following a successful Domestic Debt Exchange Programme (DDEP).He told Citi News that negotiations with China are important because China holds the majority of the external bonds, stressing that he was to lead a delegation to China to plead for debt cancellation.“The big elephant in the room is China, we will be visiting China by the end of the week to really discuss how they come into the envelope as quickly as possible. So we are looking at that support from them. China represents about a third of the $5.7 billion loan and so it is important that we engage them,” he said.Nana Yaa Jantuah believes Ghana should not have degraded to a level that a team that mocked the previous government for going for an IMF bailout will now be drowned in debt borne out of mismanagement.He partly blamed the nepotistic nature of President Akufo-Addo who is related to Ofori-Atta for the economic mess which she said had plunged the country into hunger.',\n",

We had disagreements with Mahama when he was in power. But based on what we’ve seen so far, from Nana Addo, we’ll conclude that he’s clueless, incompetent, and lacks the qualifications to be president”.When asked if they were not doing this because they are NDC members, he recalled how they supported the NPP in 2016 and was asked if they were NPP members at the time.“We had a better life under Mahama. He far outperformed Nana Addo. Today is difficult for us. We have come to regret voting for the NPP. Ghanaians are currently facing economic hardship.

       " 'Francis Addai-Nimoh has shot down claims that big names in politics give people an advantage over their peers in any political race. According to the flagbearer-hopeful of the ruling New Patriotic Party (NPP), although it appears some of the personalities who have also indicated their intentions to run for the vacant role in the party are ‘bigger’ than him, that is not what will win them the elections. He explained that it takes such attributes as character and endearment to be able to win the hearts of the delegates of the party. “Big names do not win elections. Elections are won by your character, by your good self – endearing yourself to the electorates, articulating your vision and they having the acceptability for you that you could be, and you are qualified to be their leader; not necessarily any name as such,” he explained. Speaking with GhanaWeb TV’s Etsey Atisu in an interview on Election Desk, Francis Addai-Nimoh recalled how, for instance, he out-performed many more experienced names in the party during the 2014 presidential primaries of the NPP. He said that because of the confidence the delegates have in him, he came out third in that race, even though he was regarded as the underdog in the race. “Similarly, in 2014, when the seven contestants, and I was one of them, I was seen to be the underdog; I was seen to be someone unknown in the political environment of our country. The other six contestants had all worked under J. A. Kufuor’s administration either as ministers of state, or deputy ministers of state, and Addai-Nimoh had not been in that position before. “But when we went through that process in 2014, I came in third, which was an enviable position that I secured for myself, and that shows the potential that the NPP delegates found in me and then encouraged me to make progress with this ambition,” he added.

Dr Butakor said he is an indigene and grassroots person who is well-known across the constituency adding that his experience coupled with humility, connectedness and resourcefulness will be able to attract floating voters and votes of the majority of disgruntled NPP supporters due to the abysmal performance of the NPP over the years.

       " 'Aspiring flagbearer of the NPP, Ing. Francis Addai-Nimoh, has advised Finance Minister Ken Ofori-Atta that transparency is key to winning the hearts of Ghanaians as the country continues to grapple with a debt crisis.In an interview with Don Kwabena Prah on Happy 98.9 FM’s “Epa Hoa Daben” socio-political talk show, the former Member of Parliament called on Ken Ofori-Atta, to provide data to support the Domestic Debt Exchange Programme (DDEP), which requires pensioners and other bondholders to contribute to resolving Ghana’s debt crisis.Ing. Addai-Nimoh urged the Finance Minister to compare the number of pensioners who have government bonds and the quantum of their investment with the investments of other financial institutions, such as banks and insurance companies.“At the beginning, my position on the issue was for the Finance Minister to provide the number of pensioners who have government bonds. Then the quantum of their investment. It was later that I realized the investment was around 2.2b. So compare that figure with the others, the banks, the insurance companies, and others. Then ask what the effect will be if the pensioners are exempted or added. “For me, it was just simple,” he said.However, Ing. Addai-Nimoh stressed the importance of transparency in the decision-making process, saying that the Finance Minister needs to provide the public with the necessary information so they can make informed decisions and trustIng. Addai-Nimoh believes that if the Finance Minister can provide the public with the necessary information, Ghanaians will be more willing to support efforts to address the country’s debt crisis. Ultimately, transparency will be key to winning the hearts of Ghanaians, according to the aspiring flagbearer of the NPP.“When he said we needed to help him for him to help us, that was a good statement. But then submit the spare sheets with the figures, bring them to the public so that we can understand why pensioners are in there, and with that, we can determine where the effects are insignificant or not. “Without it, they can’t trust you,” he said.“They have been exempted, and it’s refreshing to know, but we shouldn’t have dragged this issue to where we go.” The figures should have been provided so we know how much the financial institutions and their investments in government bonds total. So, if we decide to exempt pensioners and the consequences are minimal and we can still manage the debt situation, why not exempt them? “”Since they’ve been exempted, I’d commend them for standing their ground and expressing their displeasure,” he added.',\n",

       " 'A former executive of the Tema East constituency branch of the opposition National Democratic Congress (NDC), Stephen Ashitey Adjei, has accused former President Mahama of using empty promises of juicy appointments to deceive gurus of the party.In the latest of his writings on happenings in the party, Mr. Ashitey Adjei, who is popularly called Moshake, accused the former President of secretly enticing some leading figures of the party with ministerial appointments to win them over.“It is not only Ministerial appointments, even the running mate position, Mr. Mahama is playing lotto with it by promising multiple people that he will make them running Mate,” Moshake wrote.The accusation is the latest by Moshake who has been rubbing Mr. Mahama’s nose into his past mistakes which he says led to the NDC losing power twice in 2016 and 2020.His write-up which is one in a series that he has been putting out since 2020 comes as the NDC slowly builds up toward a congress to elect its flagbearer for the 2024 presidential election.Like all other salvos that Moshake has released, this one is bound to rub Mr. Mahama sore because of the facts that Moshake characteristically laces with his punches.and the write-up is coming at a time that many in the NDC are tired of the Mahama brand and are looking for a fresh face to lead the NDC which has been under the Mahama influence since 2012.The former constituency executive accuses Mr. Mahama of, “promising positions like confetti to NDC gurus just to win their favour for the upcoming presidential primary.”However, he vows that, “no empty promise will yield the loyalties of anybody because every single person in the NDC knows how neglectful John Mahama is. We remember how Mahama snubbed NDC members and appointed strangers like Raymond Atuguba, Nayong Billy Joe Alhassan Azong and others when he became president.”He called on, “all the executives that Mahama has promised the positions to reject his indecent proposal out of hand to show him he John Mahama cannot deceive any NDC guru with the promise of position.”Meanwhile, Moshake has urged the party’s delegates to, “get with the wind of change and vote massively for Dr. Kwabena Duffuor to lead the party in 2024.”',\n",

       " ' Member of Parliament for Dome Kwabenya, Sarah Adwoa Safo has made her first appearance in parliament since the House resumed sitting on February 7, 2023. The third session of the eighth Parliament resumed on February 7, 2023, after the house went on break for Christmas and new festivities. Following the resumption of the house, Adwoa Safo did not make any appearance in the chamber even though she was in the country. Adwoa Safo’s absence from parliament was one of the most discussed topics in the country in 2022. The discussion came on the back of her leaving the country after the 2022 budget was passed on November 26, 2021. However, on November 11 2022, Adwoa Safo officially resumed her parliamentary duties following her return from the United States of America. Speaker of Parliament, Alban Bagbin, on October 26, 2022, ruled that the report of the committee set up to look into her case and that of two other MPs who absented themselves for a number of sittings should be presented before the whole house for a debate. Alban Bagbin dismissed the objection of the Majority Leader, Osei Kyei-Mensah-Bonsu, to the admissibility of the committee report for the consideration of the house. “As I have noted in this ruling, the decision (sic) on not to admit a motion is the exclusive preserve of the Speaker. In view of the foregoing, the House is well within its right to receive and consider reports of the committee and make a determination arising out of the consideration. “In the circumstances, it is my ruling that the motion was rightfully admitted and the report of the committee is subject to the consideration of the house. It goes without saying that the (sic) objection of the Majority Leader today (sic) is hereby dismissed…” he concluded his verdict. YNA/KPE',\n",
       " 'The Campaign Team of Mr Alan Kyerematen, a flagbearer hopeful of the New Patriotic Party (NPP) has urged the Party to hold its presidential primaries early to offer the prospective leader adequate time to prepare for the 2024 general election. The Team has also appealed to the Party’s leadership to allow aspirants to campaign ahead of the date for the primaries to offer them enough time to engage with delegates. In an interview with the Ghana News Agency, Mr Yaw Buaben Asamoa, Spokesperson for Mr Kyerematen’s Campaign, said the Camp would prefer the presidential primaries to be held in either August or September this year. “We believe that the earlier the date, the better. If we are to succeed ourselves as an administration, then it is important that we have the next potential President early so that the President can influence public policy going forward,” he said. Mr Asamoa said if elected earlier, the flagbearer would have the opportunity to make input in the priorities and budgets of the Government in a manner that would positively affect the chances of the Party in the next general election. He said the Party’s delegates also needed enough time to meet with the aspirants and assess their capabilities, hence the need for the Party to allow the aspirants to campaign ahead of their nomination. “If the nomination process is delaying because the Party cannot fix the date for the election, then it is difficult for the candidate and the Party itself because that space could be filled with activity between delegates and potential candidates,” Mr Asamoa said. The NPP is yet to announce a date for its presidential and parliamentary primaries. The Party’s National Council met in Accra earlier this month to decide on the date for the primaries, but the meeting was reported to have ended inconclusively. The Party said it would engage broadly on the issue to arrive at a consensus. Per the NPP’s Constitution, the Party must elect its presidential candidate 11 months before the general election, when it is in power. Mr Kyerematen, who has been working towards becoming President since 207, resigned as Minister of Trade and Industry last month to pursue his presidential ambition. He officially announced his decision to contest the NPP flagbearership race in an address on January 10, 2023. In that address, Mr Kyerematen said the country required a new plan to build a self-reliant economy to avoid going back to the International Monetary Fund in future. He said if he succeeded in his quest to become President in the next general election, he would launch and lead the execution of the Great Transformational Plan of Ghana, which would span the period 2025 to 2030 to revamp key sectors of the economy. Mr Asamoa said Mr Kyerematen had so far toured the Ashanti, Bono East, Bono, Ahafo, Western North, Volta, and Eastern regions, where he met chiefs and delegates to officially inform them about his decision to contest the NPP flagbearership race. “Everywhere we have been, there is the feeling that Mr Kyerematen is the right man in the right place for the right job,” he said.',\n",

He contested the primaries in 2019 but lost to incumbent Dr James Klutse Avedzi. The aspirant, who has been touring the various branches of the NDC in the constituency ahead of the party’s Presidential and Parliamentary primaries slated for May, this year, made his intentions known in an interview with the Ghana News Agency at Dzodze. According to the business executive and professional who has served in various capacities in the NDC both in the Ketu North Constituency and at the national level and a member of the Volta and Ketu North Finance Committees of the party, he was compelled by the dream to usher in a new dawn for the NDC in Ketu North. The hopeful as affectionately called Tanko as he is affectionately believes there can be no better replacement for the incumbent Member of Parliament (MP) Dr. James Klutse Avedzi who has hinted of his decision not to run for the position again, than him (Tanko).  “My passion and effort to contribute to the development of our constituency is paramount- the evidence can be seen across the Constituency since my civil service days- I am ready and prepared for the job like no other,” he said. Mr Tanko, who is sure of winning the Ketu North NDC parliamentary primaries, intends to unite the party when he wins the constituency and national election.The seat is being eyed by Edem Agbana, the immediate past deputy National Communications officer of the party.  He advised all parliamentary primary hopefuls against a campaign of insults, attacks, and acrimony, which sometimes characterised political competitions and called for a change of the status quo. “It’s imperative that we avoid politics of insults and attacks on one another and rather focus on the messages we have as aspirants for the Branch Executives in the interest of peace and harmony going forward,” he advised. Mr Tanko said his tour of the constituency affirms his commitment of prosecuting an issue-based campaign devoid of character assassinations, and all other unhealthy discourses that may frustrate intended reconciliation activities after the elections in the Ketu North constituency. “The gate of my house remains open to all NDC faithful, who truly seek the progress of our beloved constituency,” Tanko added as he campaigns on a message of  “New Dawn” (NUBUKƐ).',\n",

We are seeking to win a third consecutive general election. We are seeking to break the eight that has so far eluded the two major political parties in the fourth republic.“Obviously, to achieve this extraordinary and unprecedented feat, we need to do the extraordinary. We cannot do the same things we’ve been doing from 1992 and expect to achieve a different result, more so, when the result in question, is one that no political party in Ghana has been able to achieve. This consciousness is what I expect to drive our 2024 project. We must all be conscious of the enormity of the task ahead of us to be able to work our hearts out towards its realization,” Chairman Ntim said while addressing a Retreat by the Council of Elders of the Greater Accra Region branch of the party at Peduase in Aburi.He added that the target of the current national executives is to ensure victory for the NPP come 2024 and nothing will stop them from achieving this objective.“Consistent with our mandate, we, as national officers, following our election in July 2022, set for ourselves, a target of working assiduously to retain power in 2024 to justify the confidence that had been reposed in us by the party’s delegates.

She made these remarks while reacting to the government’s decision to include certain individuals in its domestic debt exchange programme. “By God’s grace, Covid is not a blessing but it is a blessing in disguise because when Covid came Ghanaians had a lot of benefits from the Covid. “So, if you’re a prudent government, couldn't you have invested the Covid money and we wouldn’t have even been here chasing the IMF for just 3 billion. “Whereby you had over 21 billion from the Covid fund. What did you do with the money? The Ministry of Information paid over 1.51 billion old cedis to themselves as risk allowance. So, the government has no vision for us,” she said. Meanwhile, the Minister of Finance, Ken Ofori-Atta, has calmed the nerves of pensioner bondholders, insisting that the government will not shortchange their legitimate rights but will honour their coupon payments and maturing principals, like all government bondholders.He told Parliament that the government remained committed to the well-being and dignity of the senior citizens and pensioners.On the other hand, President Akufo-Addo has also stated that the government’s debt exchange programme (DEP) was fraught with several challenges after its announcement, but it has largely been accepted by the citizenry.He made this known when the German Federal Minister of Finance, Christian Lindner, paid him a visit at the Jubilee House.

He has no Godfather, that’s all. So they do all those evil and call it Mafia. And somebody speak out with joy to say we have played him mafia.” Mr Kwadwo Nuamah told Kwame Tanko on Angel FM Kumasi in an interview monitored by MyNewsGH.com.He further revealed that, the source of such power struggle in the party is mostly the fight between an MP and CEO of a government agency.“The issue of fight between CEO and MPs is very brutal, and it brings some kind of hatred to you. A typical example is myself. I was in the UK, sold my house, came down and did campaign. I had a 90% win in the constituency which is unprecedented, that after elections, every 9 people out of 10 will vote for you, it has never happened. The party should have even contacted me and learn how I was able to do that”, Mr Kwadwo Nuamah narrated.The former lawmaker indicated that in most cases, people who are engaged in such mafia style do not build proper relationship with the party people at the grassroots.In the 2016 Parliamentary election in Kwadaso Constituency in the Ashanti Region, Hon Samiu Kwadwo Nuamah polled 61,631 representing 90.0% while the NDC candidate Monica Bawuah had 6,263 representing 9.2% of the total votes cast.In 2004 NPP candidate had, 83.2 with NDC 13.6, 2008 NPP polled 82.7% NDC 15.3%, whiles in 2012 the NPP Had 83.6% and polling NDC 14.5%.Mr Kwadwo Nuamah was succeeded by incumbent MP for the constituency Dr. Kingsley Nyarko in 2020.',\n",

The MPs believe that Dr. Bawumia is the best bet to lead the party, and I have no doubt in my mind that he will emerge victorious,” he said.The Sefwi Akontombra MP dropped a hint that all the MPs canvassing support for the Vice President will soon come forward to unveil the cloak of anonymity for the public to know and recognise them.“We’ll be addressing a press conference to declare our support as MPs for the Vice President very soon. Dr. Bawumia is a Vice President who has shown majority and capability that he is the only person who can lead the NPP to break the eight,” he disclosed.Touching on the delegates, Mr. Djornobuah mentioned that about 80 per cent of the delegates would vote for the Vice President.“I know and believe that Western North, we’ll not disappoint the Vice President because it is time for us to reciprocate what he has done for us. And if we want more of such development then we need to vote for the Vice President,” he added.The lawmaker pointed out that Dr. Bawumia is the right person to battle former President John Dramani Mahama in the Northern regions, adding that “with the support of our strongholds in Ashanti, Eastern and other regions, we can break the eight.”He mentioned that the ruling NPP government has done marvelously well considering the challenges confronting nations across the world as a result of COVID-19 pandemic and the invasion of Ukraine by Russia, yet the government is still embarking on infrastructure development, sustaining social intervention programmes such as Free Senior High School (FSHS), One District One Factory (1D1F) among others without Ghanaians experiencing power crisis unlike under the previous National Democratic Congress (NDC).He, however, admitted that the NPP has made some mistakes in terms of governance, but was quick to add that Ghanaians are safer under NPP than NDC in terms of hardship.',\n",

He also said he will during his tenure as president of Ghana, create millionaires in all the constituencies and build state of the art offices for all orphaned constituencies.“Akufo-Addo has brought in over 1700 presidential staffers, but I am going to choose two people each from all the constituencies to work with me as presidential staffers in the flagstaff house if I win. I am also going to create millionaires in every constituency”, he addedHe further added that his bid to become the  flagbearer of the umbrella party is  not borne out of personal issues he has against a particular contestant as rumored in the public but rather on the democratic space created by the party for internal competitions.You can also watch this episode of People & Places here:',\n",
       " 'A presidential aspirant of the New Patriotic Party (NPP), Joe Ghartey has begun his Nationwide “Agenda for Hope and Unity Tour”\\u202fat the University of Mines and Technology (UMAT) branch at Essikado in the Western Region. The tour afforded him the opportunity to outdoor his Presidential bid to the Tertiary Education Student Confederacy Network (TESCON) of the New Patriotic Party (NPP) at UMAT. The tour was called off on Monday to enable him to mourn with the family of the late Dr Ato Panford, former MP for Shama constituency. Addressing the enthusiastic TESCON members of the NPP at UMAT Essikado campus, the Member of Parliament (MP) for Essikado-Ketan, said there was hope for Ghana especially the Western Region which abounds in rich natural resources. Speaking on the theme, “The Railway and Education Sectors as Tools for Economic Transformation,” the former Minister for Railways Development said his government would hinge on the Railways and Education sectors as key indicators among other sectors of the economy for economic transformation.  Joe Ghartey said the railway sector was nothing to write home about before 2017 but had witnessed an unprecedented transformation from 2017 to 2021 under his watch as the sector minister. The NPP Presidential Aspirant said what runs through his campaign message is “how to turn the economy round to improve upon living conditions of Ghanaians. He reminded the students that the foundation for development has been laid and was now left with committed people with vision to spearhead national development.  Ghartey said “if we develop the railway sector to link our major cities, there will be massive development”. According to him, Ghana required visionary leaders to make every sector work and called for attitudinal change among Ghanaians emphasizing that “law and order will permeate in every sector of his government. On Ministerial appointment, he reiterated his resolve to appoint 60 Ministers which would be based on merit.  He noted with concern that Ghana had become divisive and stressed the need to reconcile the nation, adding that Ghanaians could not continue to fight themselves in the name of partisan politics and called for unity and hope for the future. On education, the former Attorney General and Minister for Justice said Universities in the country would be improved to meet international standards. That he explained, could earn Ghana much foreign exchange that the country would not have to go to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for loans.You can also watch this episode of People & Places here:',\n",

She wrote.Linda’s declaration is coming after several months of speculation about her parliamentary ambition.For Linda, her quest to fly the flag of the party in the Adentan Constituency was borne out of her resolve to ensure better leadership for the Adentan Constituency and Ghana under H.

       " 'The New Patriotic Party (NPP) flagbearer hopeful, Francis Addai-Nimoh, has noted that even though he is naturally a quiet person, it is still in his nature to fight for his rights and what is deemed right.He said being quiet and gentle has never prevented him from going after the things he wants.According to an adomonline.com report, the former MP described himself as a very focused, result-oriented person who always gets things done despite his personality.He believes aggression is not really a requirement for achieving.To buttress his point, Mr. Addai-Nimoh, recounted a response he gave his friend, the current Minister for Health, Kwaku Agyemang Manu, some years back about his quiet nature.“I remember one time, my very good friend who is an MP; he is the Minister for Health. We were in parliament one day and he asked me why I became an MP even with my quiet nature, I also replied him that I want to leave Mampong and contest him at Dormaa Central and if he agrees, then we go ahead. I told him after giving me the chance, he will know whether I am quiet or not and we all laughed,” he said.PI/WA',\n",
       " 'A 28-year-old has declared his intention to contest the parliamentary seat for Abuakwa South seat in the upcoming NDC primaries. A.S. Nana Addo-Aikins Jnr., who is the youngest parliamentary aspirant so far, says he believes he has what it takes to spearhead the party’s transformational social agenda. The son of the former Appellate National Tribunal Chairman under the PNDC, Nana Addo-Aikins, added that he has an exceptional leadership quality and there is a need for the youth like him to be given an opportunity to work in the political space towards national development. In an interview with GhanaWeb’s Nimatu Yakubu, Nana Addo-Aikins who is a farmer said; “… drawing inspiration from that deep thinker, Maxwell, by the process of self-introspection, having discovered leadership qualities in myself, l wish to offer myself for leadership at the parliamentary level to enable me to render service to my constituency at this crucial and critical time in the annals of our great party, the NDC. “I am endowed and imbued with the character traits of selflessness, integrity, confidence, commitment, fortitude, self-denial, a sense of industry, and, above all, tenacity. The possession of those character traits, which most of us can attest to, among other factors, is a distillation of my commitment to the ideals and tenets of our great party, the NDC, in its transformational social agenda. Thus, hedonism, greed, egocentricism are opposed to every instinct in me. “I am bubbling with youthful talent and boundless potential. The youth today, like me, need opportunities to be able to participate effectively in the political processes so as to empower us to contribute to finding practical solutions that advance national development. It is also important not to stifle the voice of the youth; on the contrary, we should make them find their voice in politics to give them the opportunity to contribute to national development. It is in the light of all those aforementioned facts that l have decided to serve my constituency and Ghana as a whole on the ticket of our great party. I am committed to winning the seat for our party,“ he added. He called on Ghanaians and the NDC party at large to solidarise with him as he is ready to make a huge impact in the development of the country. “l crave your indulgence to give me the chance to represent my party in Parliament, for the sake of the greater good of the party, as well as for the collective good of all Ghanaians. We shall work together, in faith and in trust, to find out the best approach, which will enable the NDC to cancel out its vote deficit so as to make voter gains in the constituency,” he added.Profile of Nana Addo Aikins Nana Addo-Aikins is a native of Akyem Asafo in the Abuakwa South Municipality, born on September 7, 1994. He attended the Golden Sunbeam International College Of Science and Technology and the Ghana Institute Of Management And Public Administration (GIMPA).
